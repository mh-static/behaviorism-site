      <title>Another Blood Test for Depression</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/another-blood-test-for-depression/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, courtesy of Talla Trialogue on Twitter, I have read an article by Shari Roan called &lt;i&gt;Blood Test for Depression Proves It&amp;rsquo;s Not All In Your Head&lt;/i&gt;.  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/01/25/major-depression-can-be-diagnosed-blood-test&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article appears to be an interview with Lonna Williams, the CEO of Ridge Diagnostics.  This company is reportedly introducing a blood test for depression.  The test is called MDDScore and is expected to cost $745.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article tells us that:  &amp;ldquo;You get a numerical score that suggests how likely it is that you have depression. Studies show that MDD Score is about as accurate at making a diagnosis as the most rigorous evaluations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Conflicts of Interest in Psychiatry</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-conflicts-of-interest-in-psychiatry/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-conflicts-of-interest-in-psychiatry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come across an article by Lisa Cosgrove et al entitled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jep.12016/abstract&#34;&gt;Conflicts of interest and the quality of recommendations in clinical guidelines.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;It was published in the Journal of &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Evaluation in Clinical Practice in December of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone knows, the APA publishes the DSM, but they also publish &amp;ldquo;Clinical Practice Guidelines&amp;rdquo; for various &amp;ldquo;diagnoses,&amp;rdquo; including the condition known as major depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cosgrove and her colleagues examined the guidelines for major depression to see if the authors had financial or intellectual conflicts of interest.  An example of a financial conflict of interest would be recommending drug treatment when one is on the payroll of a drug company.  An example of an intellectual conflict of interest would be relying on and citing a poor quality study in support of a position in which one had a stake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shock &#34;Treatment&#34; Is Not Safe and Provides Little If Any Benefit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DELICATE THINGS REQUIRE DELICATE HANDLING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, one of my hobbies was making small transistor radios.  It sounds complicated, but is well within the reach of an average 15-year-old.  You get some magazine articles, learn how to read a circuit, and learn how to use a soldering iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transistor is a small device – about half the size of a pencil eraser – with three wires coming out of it.  In building a radio receiver, the transistors have to be soldered to other devices which are in turn soldered to other devices, etc…  The soldering iron is plugged into a wall outlet, but no mains electricity reaches the tip of the iron.  However, tiny eddy currents can circulate in the tip, and although they are only of the order of &lt;i&gt;milliamps&lt;/i&gt;, they can burn a transistor in seconds.  What you have to do is unplug the iron from the socket, make the joint with the tip&amp;rsquo;s retained heat, and then replug the iron to have it ready for the next joint.  The point being that &lt;i&gt;delicate things require delicate handling&lt;/i&gt;, and that &lt;strong&gt;electricity can be very destructive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 5, 2013, a bipartisan panel of leading mental health experts and parents of children with &amp;ldquo;mental disorders&amp;rdquo; held a conversation (that&amp;rsquo;s newspeak for meeting) in Washington D.C. on the topic: Violence and Severe Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invited panelists were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;Thomas Insel, MD, Director of NIMH
Harold Koplewicz, MD, President of Child Mind Institute
E. Fuller Torrey, MD, Founder of Treatment Advocacy Center
Michael Welner, MD, Founder and Chairman of The Forensic Panel
Michael Fitzpatrick, MSW, Director of NAMI
And three parents of &#34;diagnosed&#34; children&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Play Therapy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/play-therapy/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/play-therapy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across an interesting article &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiddaman.blogspot.co.nz/2013/02/psychiatric-medication-or-play-therapy.html&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psychiatric Medication or Play Therapy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bob Fiddaman, a New Zealand writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article compares the efficacy and dangers of play therapy vs. pharmaceutical products for children with various problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;…play therapy outcome studies support the efficacy of this intervention with children suffering from various emotional and behavioral difficulties.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on marketing psychiatric medication.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Front groups that purport to fly the mental health flag are, in fact, nothing more than agents, pimps for the pharmaceutical industry.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another interesting article:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://leoniefennell.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/academic-integrity-in-ireland-and-the-uk-is-there-any-such-thing/&#34;&gt;Academic Integrity in Ireland and the UK: Is there any such thing?&lt;/a&gt; at Leonie fennells&amp;rsquo; Blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about financial ties between pharmaceutical companies and psychiatrists.  Same old story; different location.  It&amp;rsquo;s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Becky @yobluemama2 on Twitter for drawing my attention to this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post was updated on March 22, 2015 to incorporate suggestions from a reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I was asked by an acquaintance for some &lt;strong&gt;suggestions for dealing with a bout of depression&lt;/strong&gt;.  As I was writing these out it occurred to me that the material might have some general interest, so I decided to publish it as a new post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have worked with a great many people who expressed concerns about dealing with depression.  These are the suggestions I gave these individuals which I believe were the most helpful: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>If Depression Is Not An Illness, What Is It?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/if-depression-is-not-an-illness-what-is-it/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/if-depression-is-not-an-illness-what-is-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2009/07/28/depression/#.URp1BKVEEeU&#34;&gt;Elsewhere on this site&lt;/a&gt;, I have argued that depression is not an illness, but rather is an&lt;strong&gt; adaptive mechanism that encourages us to make changes &lt;/strong&gt;in our habits or our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written about what I call the seven natural anti-depressants:  good nutrition; fresh air; sunshine (in moderation); physical activity; purposeful activity; good relationships; and adequate and regular sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question has often been posed:  Why does this adaptive mechanism apparently not work in some cases?  Why is it that for some people the unpleasant feeling fails to act as a spur to make changes, and instead the person sinks further into despondency and inactivity?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depression is Not a Brain Defect</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/depression-is-not-a-brain-defect/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 14:15:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/depression-is-not-a-brain-defect/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve come across an article by psychologist Bruce Levine, PhD, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/04/how-the-brain-defect-theory-of-depression-stigmatizes-depression-sufferers/&#34;&gt;How the “Brain Defect” Theory of Depression Stigmatizes Depression Sufferers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine convincingly debunks the brain defect theory, and also the notion that the illness theory destigmatizes depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; “Americans have been increasingly socialized to be terrified of the overwhelming pain that can fuel depression, and they have been taught to distrust their own and other’s ability to overcome it. This terror, like any terror, inhibits critical thinking. Without critical thinking, it is difficult to accurately assess the legitimacy of authorities. And Americans have become easy prey for mental health authorities’ proclamation that depression is a result of a brain defect.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry – The Sham Science</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatry-the-sham-science/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 13:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatry-the-sham-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting article in last month’s issue of the British Journal of Psychiatry.  The article, titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5cLaT3gdm9NMTF2MVBfU1paOUk/edit&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychiatry beyond the current paradigm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was authored by Pat Bracken, an Irish psychiatrist, and 28 other British and Irish psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of the piece is that the &lt;strong&gt;current psychiatric paradigm&lt;/strong&gt;, which the authors describe as “applied neuroscience,” is &lt;strong&gt;not supported by the evidence&lt;/strong&gt; and needs to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSRI’s and Suicide Risk for Adolescents</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ssri-s-and-suicide-risk-for-adolescents/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2012 10:50:23 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ssri-s-and-suicide-risk-for-adolescents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This issue has been debated for years, but was finally considered to have been put to rest by NIMH’s 2004 Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS).  This study essentially “found” that fluoxetine (Prozac) was effective in treating depression and did not involve an increased risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Whitaker’s most recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mad-in-america/201202/the-real-suicide-data-the-tads-study-comes-light&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; points out that TADS actually found that adolescents treated with fluoxetine had a markedly higher risk for suicidal activity than those who received a placebo.  Robert also outlines the various statistical and methodological ploys that were used to conceal this finding and to sanitize the final report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More about Antidepressants and Placebos</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-about-antidepressants-and-placebos/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2012 10:39:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-about-antidepressants-and-placebos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The debate is over.  Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.  And yet the “depression-is-an-illness” lobby continues to grasp for straws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona Godlee, editor of the British Medical Journal, recently cited “evidence” of the efficacy of antidepressants.  For a &lt;a href=&#34;http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/everybody-has-won-and-all-must-have.html&#34;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; of the Godlee article go to Duncan Double’s website “&lt;a href=&#34;http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Critical Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise finding! - Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means in effect is that people are “curing” their own depression (gasp), and perhaps don’t really need the mental health practitioners (double gasp).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Blood Test for Depression</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/a-blood-test-for-depression/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2011 18:28:12 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/a-blood-test-for-depression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Carlat in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/08/blood-test-for-depression-really.html&#34;&gt;blog post of August 15 &lt;/a&gt;mentions, and critiques, a so-called blood test for depression marketed (for $745) by Ridge Diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of Dr. Carlat’s criticism is that the test is not &lt;em&gt;predictive&lt;/em&gt; of depression, but merely enables one to tell (with some degree of accuracy) whether or not a person &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;depressed.  Dr. Carlat makes the point that you can tell this with more or less total accuracy simply by asking the person if he is depressed or by observing him for a few minutes of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Health (NIH) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  It is the primary U.S. Government agency responsible for medical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH has 27 sub-departments, one of which is the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  The NIMH has an annual budget of $1.5 billion, which they use to support research through grants and in-house work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago the NIMH approved a $35 million grant for the STAR*D study (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression).  The study was conducted  “…to determine the effectiveness of different treatments for people with major depression who have not responded to initial treatment with an antidepressant.”  This was to be the largest and longest study ever conducted to evaluate depression treatment, the results of which are now available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Interesting Post On Depression</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/an-interesting-post-on-depression/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/an-interesting-post-on-depression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s some interesting reading at &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/04/06/frightening-story-behind-the-drug-companies-creation-of-medical-lobotomies.aspx&#34;&gt;Mercola.com&lt;/a&gt; posted April 6, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mercola states that depression is not an illness! - and that this bogus illness was created by psychiatrists and drug companies in order to sell drugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprises there for regular readers of this site.  Unfortunately Dr. Mercola doesn’t take the logic far enough.  Although he rightly debunks depression as an illness, he clings to the notion that other “mental illnesses” are bona fide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every society in every generation makes errors.  Some of the errors are minor.  Some are major.  One of the great errors of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was this:  we accepted the spurious notion that a wide range of life’s problems were in fact &lt;em&gt;illnesses&lt;/em&gt;.  This spurious notion was initiated with good intentions – to provide shelter and humanitarian care for a relatively small number of individuals whose plight was truly dreadful.  But then the concept of mental illness took off, fuelled largely by the efforts of psychiatrists to legitimize their status as “real” doctors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drugs, Placebos, and Life</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/drugs-placebos-and-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2010 18:53:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/drugs-placebos-and-life/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently read a very interesting book by Irving Kirsch, PhD.  It’s called &lt;i&gt;The Emperor’s New Drugs&lt;/i&gt;, and the central theme of the work is that antidepressants are only very slightly more effective than placebos (i.e. sugar pills), and that the difference is not clinically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic is cogent and the research is rigorous.  Read the book and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirsch argues in favor of psychotherapy as a substitute for pills.  And certainly talking is usually helpful.  However, as long as depression is conceptualized as an illness, I don’t believe we will see real progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depression Is Not An Illness: It is an Adaptive Mechanism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Post edited and updated March 9, 2013, to reflect additional thoughts as a result of interactions with the many people who left comments. I thank them for their input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEPRESSION – AN ADAPTIVE MECHANISM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the APA’s assertion, depression is not an illness. In fact, depression is an adaptive mechanism which has served humanity well for millions of years. When things are going well in our lives, we feel good. This good feeling is nature’s way of telling us to keep doing what we’re doing. When our lives are not going well, we feel down or depressed. This is nature’s way of telling us to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the anxiety disorders listed in DSM-IV is posttraumatic stress disorder. The criteria for this condition are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;(1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others
(2) the person&#39;s response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Note: in children, this may be expressed instead by disorganized or agitated behavior&lt;/p&gt;</description>
