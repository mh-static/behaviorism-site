      <title>The Bereavement Exclusion and DSM-5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In DSM-IV, a &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; of major depressive &lt;i&gt;disorder&lt;/i&gt; is based on the presence of a major depressive &lt;i&gt;episode&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major depressive &lt;i&gt;episode&lt;/i&gt;, in turn, is defined by the presence of five or more items from the following list during a two-week period:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;(1) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). Note&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Another Blood Test for Depression</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/another-blood-test-for-depression/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/another-blood-test-for-depression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, courtesy of Talla Trialogue on Twitter, I have read an article by Shari Roan called &lt;i&gt;Blood Test for Depression Proves It&amp;rsquo;s Not All In Your Head&lt;/i&gt;.  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/01/25/major-depression-can-be-diagnosed-blood-test&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article appears to be an interview with Lonna Williams, the CEO of Ridge Diagnostics.  This company is reportedly introducing a blood test for depression.  The test is called MDDScore and is expected to cost $745.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article tells us that:  &amp;ldquo;You get a numerical score that suggests how likely it is that you have depression. Studies show that MDD Score is about as accurate at making a diagnosis as the most rigorous evaluations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago (March 23), the New York Times did a feature on &amp;ldquo;Defining Mental Illness.&amp;rdquo;  They invited Ronald Pies, MD (a psychiatry professor at SUNY Upstate Medical University and Tufts University) to submit a brief paper on this topic.  Various people with opposing views were allowed to respond, and finally Dr. Pies presented a much longer summary and rebuttal.  You can see the entire print version &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-defining-mental-illness.html?ref=opinion&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Somatic Symptom Disorder in DSM-5: You&#39;re Crazy to Worry about Your Health</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In DSM-IV, there is a category called Somatoform Disorders, the common feature of which is a preoccupation with &amp;ldquo;… physical symptoms that suggest a general medical condition …and are not fully explained by a general medical condition…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four of the &amp;ldquo;diagnoses&amp;rdquo; in this category will be retired in DSM-5 and will be replaced by a new &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo;:  &lt;em&gt;somatic symptom disorder&lt;/em&gt;.  The four superseded &amp;ldquo;diagnoses&amp;rdquo; are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;1.  somatization disorder
2.  hypochondriasis
3.  pain disorder
4.  undifferentiated somatoform disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In DSM-5, A-D-H-D Still Spells Misbehavior</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a central theme of this website that there are no mental illnesses/disorders, and that the psychiatric medicalization of ordinary human problems is arbitrary, spurious, and destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread acceptance of ADHD as a mental illness/chemical imbalance has no scientific underpinning, but rather is based on marketing and promotion.  The ADHD &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; is particularly destructive, in that it targets &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt;, and serves as the justification for &amp;ldquo;treating&amp;rdquo; these children with dangerous drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DSM-5 Inter-Rater Reliability is Low</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/the-dsm-5-field-trials-inter-rater-reliability-ratings-take-a-nose-dive/&#34;&gt;article by Jack Carney&lt;/a&gt;, DSW, on this topic on Mad in America.  Jack refers to the DSM-5 field trials published earlier this year in the American Journal of Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inter-rater reliability is measured by a statistic called a kappa score.  A score of 1 means perfect inter-rater agreement; a score of 0 indicates zero agreement.  In psychosocial research a kappa score of 0.7 or above is generally considered good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting new article by Paula Caplan &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-isnt-golden/201303/comedy-history-and-the-future-mental-disorder-labels&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It discusses the harmful effects of psychiatric &amp;ldquo;diagnoses,&amp;rdquo; including the fact that because of these labels, people have lost their &amp;ldquo;… jobs, custody of children, health insurance, and the right to make decisions about their medical and legal affairs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula also mentions a petition she created in December 2011 calling for &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Congressional Hearings about Psychiatric Diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  The petition is still up. You can find it&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.change.org/petitions/everyone-who-cares-about-the-harm-done-by-psychiatric-diagnosis-endorse-the-call-for-congressional-hearings-about-psychiatric-diagnosis&#34;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/03/16/dsm-5-another-step-in-the-wrong-direction/#.UU3-8xyG0eU&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;DSM-5: Another Step in the Wrong Direction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In that article I argued that DSM-5 was simply another step in the APA&amp;rsquo;s ongoing agenda to medicalize &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; human problems and to legitimize the administration of drugs as the front line &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; to these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also expressed concern that the widely publicized movement to develop an alternative diagnostic system might not look all that different from what we have today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DSM-5: Another Step in the Wrong Direction</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsm-5-another-step-in-the-wrong-direction/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsm-5-another-step-in-the-wrong-direction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s widely known that the initial drafts of DSM-5 received a great deal of negative comment.  It&amp;rsquo;s also known that some of the more controversial proposals have been scrapped, but that others have been retained and sent for printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this was fairly predictable.  The APA&amp;rsquo;s agenda is to widen the &amp;ldquo;diagnostic&amp;rdquo; net to include as many people as possible.  But they&amp;rsquo;re not complete fools.  They know that there&amp;rsquo;s a good deal of anti-psychiatry feeling out there, so in my view, they floated some very contentious proposals, fully accepting that these would be withdrawn under pressure, thereby creating the perception that they are reasonable folk just trying to do what&amp;rsquo;s right.  Meanwhile, other proposals go under the wire unscathed, and the &amp;ldquo;diagnostic&amp;rdquo; net is widened.  Mission accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry – the Pseudoscience</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As most readers of this website are aware, there is a great deal of resistance to the soon-to-be-released DSM-5.  There is even a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/02/dsm-5-boycott-launched/&#34;&gt;Boycott DSM-5 Committee &lt;/a&gt;established by Jack Carney, and many people are suggesting that practitioners use the World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s (WHO&amp;rsquo;s) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the general context of this debate, I have come across an article by Philip Thomas, M.D. – &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/02/pinball-wizards-and-the-doomed-project-of-psychiatric-diagnosis/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pinball Wizards and the Doomed Project of Psychiatric Diagnosis.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;  Dr. Thomas points out that &amp;ldquo;…it’s hard to imagine that the criticisms raised about DSM-5 won’t also apply to the ICD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Steven Novella M.D. and Mental Illness Denial</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/steven-novella-m-d-and-mental-illness-denial/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2013 16:58:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/steven-novella-m-d-and-mental-illness-denial/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently Nick Stuart, a regular commenter on this website, drew my attention to Dr. Steven Novella.  Dr. Novella is a strong supporter of the standard psychiatric system, and routinely refers to those of us who challenge these concepts as &amp;ldquo;mental illness deniers.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/mental-illness-denial-part-i/&#34;&gt;(Mental Illness Denial Part I)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick referred me to some of Dr. Novella&amp;rsquo;s articles, and I published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/01/27/a-critical-look-at-critical-psychiatry/#.USVHtKWG0eU&#34;&gt;brief response&lt;/a&gt;.  I have been giving these matters some thought, however, and I think the subject matter warrants more attention. This is because Dr. Novella does indeed marshal some compelling arguments in other areas, and also because he routinely condemns us &amp;ldquo;deniers&amp;rdquo; as illogical employers of &amp;ldquo;…semantic misdirection and evasion…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Criticism of DSM-5</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lane, author of &lt;i&gt;Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness,&lt;/i&gt; has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201302/dsm-5-has-gone-press-containing-major-scientific-gaffe&#34;&gt;new post&lt;/a&gt;, in which he attacks the APA for including somatic symptom disorder (SSD) in the upcoming DSM-5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lane quotes from Allen Francis (former DSM guru who has now seen the light) and Suzy Chapman, a UK health advocate.  Both of these commentators attack the new &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; as invalid, unreliable, and potentially over-inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Childhood Bipolar Disorder</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/childhood-bipolar-disorder/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to about 1994, childhood bipolar disorder was virtually unheard of.  DSM-III-R (1987), in the section on manic episode, states, “…studies indicate that the mean age at onset is in the early 20s.  However…a sizable number of new cases appear after age 50.”(p 216)  Of course a &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; age of onset in the early 20’s could include young children.  The section on major depressive episode, however, contains the following:  “The average age of onset is in the late 20s, but a major depressive episode may begin at any age, including infancy.” (p 220)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DSM-5:  More of the Same - Turf Expansion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsm-5-more-of-the-same-turf-expansion/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/dsm-5-more-of-the-same-turf-expansion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until now, I’ve pretty much steered clear of DSM-5.  My reason for this is that the upcoming revision represents, to my mind, a distraction from the central issue, i.e., that the whole notion of mental illness is spurious, destructive nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My position is that the purpose of DSM is to expand psychiatric turf and to legitimize the pushing of mood/behavior-altering pharmaceuticals. In the US (and I believe in most developed countries) you can’t prescribe a drug without a diagnosis.  And the APA has never neglected its primary mission in this area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Cracks in the Sandcastle</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-cracks-in-the-sandcastle/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/more-cracks-in-the-sandcastle/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lane has a post up on Psychology Today (May 14 2012) called:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201205/dsm-5-is-diagnosed-stinging-rebuke-the-apa&#34;&gt;DSM-5 Is Diagnosed, With a Stinging Rebuke to the APA.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, the APA announced the new “diagnoses” that they proposed to include in the upcoming DSM-5.  This kind of expansion is nothing new.  The APA has been engaged in the medicalization of every conceivable human problem for the past 50 or 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on this occasion, some of their more creative and potentially damaging creations generated a good deal of fairly vocal opposition.  The upshot of this is a decision by the APA to drop two of the more contentious “diagnoses:”  - “attenuated psychosis syndrome” and “mixed anxiety and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Too Much Sex?</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/too-much-sex/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lane recently published an interesting&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201204/american-sex-and-american-psychiatry&#34;&gt; article &lt;/a&gt;on Psychology Today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article covers a number of topics, including the APA’s proposal to include “hypersexual disorder” in the upcoming DSM-5.  The implications of this proposed “diagnosis” are that if you think about sex too much or engage in sexual activity too much, then you have a mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 60’s, when I was at college, I would frequently find myself chatting with a group of fellow students on a wide range of topics, including sex.  Often someone would cite the old statistic that the average young adult male thinks about sex 171 times a day (or whatever), to which the chorus of replies was always – “no way; it’s much more often than that.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/eccentricity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I received the following email from a reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;“What’s your stance on eccentricity? How do you relate to the general view in the APA that deviation from cultural norms is pathological? And, have you ever read about David Weeks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;I consider myself an eccentric person with many quirks and some fetishes. While I have many friends who share the same interests or many of them, I still feel a little bad about psychiatrists labeling eccentricity with SPD or Schizoid personality disorder. I am 19, and my friends are from the 18-25 years of age, and we share a common love for anime and cartoons. Maybe not always the same but sometimes we share two or more common cartoons. Some of them also are collectors of stuffed animals and figurines like me, and some of them engage in masturbation with those objects as me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;Normal&#34; Bereavement</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2012 22:50:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/normal-bereavement/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a nice article in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960248-7/fulltext&#34;&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt; last month.  The article posed the question: “When should grief be classified as a mental illness?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author criticized the APA’s draft version of DSM-5 for blurring the distinction and for making it more likely that people in bereavement will be “diagnosed” as depressed and, of course, “treated” with prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a good deal of criticism against the APA on this issue, and it is likely that the final version of DSM-5 will reflect some retreat in this matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Carlat’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; carries an &lt;a href=&#34;http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/apa-threatens-to-sue-dsm5watch-website.html&#34;&gt;interesting item&lt;/a&gt;.  It seems that a lady named Suzy Chapman started a site called dsm5watch, in which she expressed criticism of the DSM.  Well, the APA didn’t like this and sent her a cease and desist letter, claiming that the string “DSM-5” is trademarked, and that she was infringing their rights.  She complied, changing the name of her site to &lt;a href=&#34;http://dxrevisionwatch.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;dxrevisionwatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting here is that the APA claim to be interested in public comment.  I guess as long as it doesn’t get too critical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this post as a response to a comment posted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://drpullen.com/&#34;&gt;medical blog&lt;/a&gt; in my previous post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2011/02/24/more-on-so-called-bipolar-disorder/#comments&#34;&gt;More on So-called Bipolar Disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2001 I became very ill.  The symptoms were exhaustion and mild nosebleeds. I went to three different practitioners, but they all were dismissive of my concerns, assured me that I was in good health, and sent me on my way.   On August 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of that year I was admitted to the hospital in Greeley, Colorado with complete kidney failure.  The nephrologist at the hospital gave me the &lt;em&gt;diagnosis&lt;/em&gt; that had eluded the earlier doctors:  Wegener’s Granulomatosis - a rare autoimmune disease that attacks lungs, kidneys, and airways. I have been on dialysis every since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
