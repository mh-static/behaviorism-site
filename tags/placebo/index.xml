      <description>&lt;p&gt;The debate is over.  Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.  And yet the “depression-is-an-illness” lobby continues to grasp for straws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona Godlee, editor of the British Medical Journal, recently cited “evidence” of the efficacy of antidepressants.  For a &lt;a href=&#34;http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/everybody-has-won-and-all-must-have.html&#34;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; of the Godlee article go to Duncan Double’s website “&lt;a href=&#34;http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Critical Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise finding! - Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means in effect is that people are “curing” their own depression (gasp), and perhaps don’t really need the mental health practitioners (double gasp).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drugs, Placebos, and Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently read a very interesting book by Irving Kirsch, PhD.  It’s called &lt;i&gt;The Emperor’s New Drugs&lt;/i&gt;, and the central theme of the work is that antidepressants are only very slightly more effective than placebos (i.e. sugar pills), and that the difference is not clinically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic is cogent and the research is rigorous.  Read the book and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirsch argues in favor of psychotherapy as a substitute for pills.  And certainly talking is usually helpful.  However, as long as depression is conceptualized as an illness, I don’t believe we will see real progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
