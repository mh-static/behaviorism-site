      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come across an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/21/elderly-care-antipsychotics-sharp-rise&#34;&gt;article from the Manchester Guardian&lt;/a&gt; on this topic.Â  The article is by Sarah Boseley, and is a review of a UK study in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society written by Aideen Maguire, C. Hughes, Chris Cardwell, and Dermot O&amp;rsquo;Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the Northern Ireland prescribing database and discovered that when people were admitted to nursing homes, the &lt;strong&gt;rate at which they were prescribed anti-psychotic drugs increased from 1.1% to 20.3%!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
