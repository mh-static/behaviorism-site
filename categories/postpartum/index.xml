      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/24/postpartum-depression/&#34;&gt;post on postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt; which has generated a certain amount of negative comment.  For this reason, I thought it might be helpful to clarify some points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEFINITION AND EXPLANATIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSM makes no mention of postpartum depression as such.  The closest it comes is major depressive disorder with postpartum onset.  In other words, the APA conceptualizes postpartum depression as ordinary major depression (which can incidentally range in severity from mild to severe) which happens to occur in the postpartum period.  This is in marked contrast to the popular notion that postpartum depression is somehow a function of the postpartum woman&amp;rsquo;s hormones, and is fundamentally different from other forms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
