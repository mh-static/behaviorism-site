      <title>Psychiatry Debunks the &#39;Myths&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Psychiatry has always had its share of critics, but in the past two decades these criticisms have increased in frequency and intensity.  Psychiatry&#39;s underlying concepts are being denounced as spurious to the point of inanity, and its practices are being accurately and forcefully exposed as destructive, disempowering, and stigmatizing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry has no rational or logical response to these criticisms.  Its leadership and its rank and file remain stubbornly blind to the arbitrariness and invalidity of its so-called diagnoses, the unquestioning adoption of which distorts their perceptions of people and their problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 17, 2013, Peter Kinderman, PhD, Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University of Liverpool, wrote an article titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20986796&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grief and Anxiety are not mental illnesses&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 4, 2013, Steven Novella, MD, wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/dsm-v-mental-illness-vs-normal-behavior/&#34;&gt;critique of Dr. Kinderman&amp;rsquo;s article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 20, I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/02/20/steven-novella-m-d-and-mental-illness-denial/&#34;&gt;critique of Dr. Novella&amp;rsquo;s article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, on September 17, Dr. Novella wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/more-on-mental-illness-denial-and-how-not-to-argue/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;More On Mental Illness Denial and How Not to Argue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a critique of my critique.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Postpartum Depression Not an Illness</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/postpartum-depression-not-an-illness/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2013 09:43:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/postpartum-depression-not-an-illness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of the bio-psychiatric-pharma faction is to &lt;strong&gt;expand turf and sell more drugs&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is a multi-faceted endeavor, one component of which is disease mongering.  This consists of using marketing techniques to persuade large numbers of people that they have an illness which needs to be treated with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to postpartum depression, it is an obvious fact that some mothers do indeed experience a measure of depression in the period after giving birth.  The term postpartum depression has in the past been generally understood to mean that the problem had something to do with hormones.  Today brain chemicals are blamed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Critical Look at Critical Psychiatry</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/a-critical-look-at-critical-psychiatry/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jan 2013 22:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/a-critical-look-at-critical-psychiatry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.criticalpsychiatry.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Critical Psychiatry Network&lt;/a&gt; is a group of British psychiatrists who are developing and promoting concepts that question and criticize the assumptions that underlie present-day psychiatric practice, not only in Britain, but also in the US and other developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical Psychiatry challenges the notion that the various DSM &amp;ldquo;diagnoses&amp;rdquo; are biologically-based illnesses, and adduces a great deal of evidence to the contrary.  They stress the cultural/social aspect of psychiatric diagnosing.  For instance, they point out that a &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; of ADHD is a cultural construct which provides schools and parents with a socially acceptable method of dealing with difficult children (rather than an identification of an illness).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depression is Not a Brain Defect</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-is-not-a-brain-defect/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 14:15:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-is-not-a-brain-defect/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve come across an article by psychologist Bruce Levine, PhD, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/04/how-the-brain-defect-theory-of-depression-stigmatizes-depression-sufferers/&#34;&gt;How the “Brain Defect” Theory of Depression Stigmatizes Depression Sufferers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine convincingly debunks the brain defect theory, and also the notion that the illness theory destigmatizes depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; “Americans have been increasingly socialized to be terrified of the overwhelming pain that can fuel depression, and they have been taught to distrust their own and other’s ability to overcome it. This terror, like any terror, inhibits critical thinking. Without critical thinking, it is difficult to accurately assess the legitimacy of authorities. And Americans have become easy prey for mental health authorities’ proclamation that depression is a result of a brain defect.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
