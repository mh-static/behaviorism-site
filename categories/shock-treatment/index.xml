      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 25 of this year, Psychiatric Times published an article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/UjKaj-March-25-2015Psychiatric_Times_-_Dementia_Agitation_and_Aggression_The_Role_of_Electroconvulsive_Therapy_-_2015-03-25.pdf&#34;&gt;Dementia, Agitation, and Aggression: The Role of Electroconvulsive Therapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  The author is Manjola Ujkaj, MD PhD, and the article&amp;rsquo;s subtitle is &amp;ldquo;What role might electroconvulsive therapy play for short-term treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with dementia?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/contribute-site&#34;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; Psychiatric Times is a medical trade publication that covers news, reports, and clinical content related to psychiatry &amp;ldquo;for psychiatrists and allied mental health professionals who treat mental disorders.&amp;rdquo;  The circulation of the monthly print publication is approximately 40,000.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 16, 2014, the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry published an article by Deepa Archarya, PhD, et al.  The article is titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Archaya%2C+Harper%2C+Achtyes%2C+seiner+2014&#34;&gt;Safety and utility of acute electroconvulsive therapy for agitation and aggression in dementia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  Here are the authors&amp;rsquo; conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Electroconvulsive therapy may be a safe treatment option to reduce symptoms of agitation and aggression in patients with dementia whose behaviors are refractory to medication management.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
In their Introduction section, the authors write:
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Despite the high prevalence of these agitated and aggressive behaviors, there are currently no treatment options approved by US Food and Drug Administration for this indication. Nonpharmacological interventions, including environmental and behavioral modification, are difficult to implement in nursing home settings because of low staff-to-resident ratios.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Macabre Celebration:  80 Years of Convulsive &#39;Therapy&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article in the June 2014 issue of the Journal of ECT.  It&amp;rsquo;s written by Max Fink, MD, and is titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.lww.com/ectjournal/citation/2014/06000/celebrating_80_years_of_inducing_brain_seizures_as.3.aspx&#34;&gt;Celebrating 80 Years of Inducing Brain Seizures as Psychiatric Treatment.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;Dr. Fink is a psychiatrist and neurologist, and professor emeritus of psychiatry and neurology at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is short (approximately 400 words), and is essentially a tribute to Ladislas Meduna for his discovery  &amp;ldquo;…that induced seizures alleviated severe psychiatric disorders…&amp;rdquo;, which Dr. Fink describes as  &amp;ldquo;…a remarkable medical advance…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;TMS is a psychiatric treatment that uses a rapidly alternating magnetic field to induce electric currents in the brain.  These currents stimulate neurons, causing them to &amp;ldquo;fire.&amp;rdquo; When used repetitively, TMS is said to alter the excitability of the brain area that has been stimulated.  In the psychiatric field, TMS is being used increasingly as a treatment for depression, particularly with so-called treatment-resistant clients.  I Googled the string &amp;ldquo;TMS + depression&amp;rdquo; and got 1.35 million hits.  So the idea is attracting attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Effective?</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/is-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-effective/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2013 05:58:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/is-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-effective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ECT, or shock treatment as it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes called, is a controversial topic.  Adherents describe it as safe and effective; opponents condemn its use as damaging and ineffective.  But it is still widely used in the US and in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment consists essentially of passing sufficient electricity across the brain to cause a seizure.  Clients are anesthetized during the process.  It is used primarily in cases of severe depression.  Typically, shock treatment is administered twice a week until the depression remits or until no further improvement is noted in two successive sessions.  Most courses of treatment involve about eight sessions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new article on Frontiers in Psychiatry.  It&amp;rsquo;s titled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuropsychiatric_Imaging_and_Stimulation/10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00094/full&#34;&gt;Electroconvulsive treatment:  hypotheses about mechanisms of action&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/i&gt; The authors are Roar Fosse, Division of Mental Health and Addiction, Vestro Viken State Hospital Trust, Lier, Norway, and John Read, Institute of Psychology, Health, and Society, University of Liverpool, UK.  Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MickBramham&#34;&gt;Mick Bramham on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors reviewed a large number of human studies in which the brains of people receiving shock treatment were observed using EEG, PET, SPECT, and fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ECT – Benefits Are Short-lived</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Monday (August 26), Lauren Spiro published a post on Mad in America.  The post is titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/08/reachable-vision-america-achieving-nothing-us-without-us-2015/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Today Show and ECT: The Full Story &amp;amp; Informed Consent&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the gist of Lauren&amp;rsquo;s article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 20, the Today Show ran a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.today.com/health/electroshock-no-longer-taboo-treating-mental-illness-6C10960583&#34;&gt;segment on ECT&lt;/a&gt; (electric shock &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo;).  Lauren contends that the coverage was not balanced, but was pitched heavily in favor of shock &amp;ldquo;treatment.&amp;rdquo;  Lauren provides a link to the segment, and also a transcript.  I have watched the video, and read the transcript, and I agree that the coverage was very much pro-ECT, and that side effects were trivialized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shock Treatment In Israel</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/shock-treatment-in-israel/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2013 06:42:51 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/shock-treatment-in-israel/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come across (courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TallaTrialogue&#34;&gt;Tallaght Trialogue on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) an article titled: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://occupypsychiatry.net/2013/130804IsraeliCtSaysNoForcedElectroshock.htm&#34;&gt;The Court: Electroshock treatments should not be forced on psychiatric patients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;  The original was in Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, and was written by Edna Adato.  The English version above was on occupypsychiatry.net, and was translated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RealJannaWeiss&#34;&gt;Janna Weiss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is brief, and the content is straightforward.  As a result of a recent Israeli court ruling, electric shock treatment will not be administered against a person&amp;rsquo;s will, even if the person has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ECT And Adolescents At The Mayo Clinic</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/ect-and-adolescents-at-the-mayo-clinic/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the APA annual convention in San Francisco in May of this year, Chad Puffer, DO, of the Mayo Clinic, presented a poster display titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Puffer_Wall_APA_2013-05-13-1.pdf&#34;&gt;ECT Use in Adolescents at the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;The poster was reported by Caroline Cassels of Medscape.com, a month later (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806923&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ECT in Kids:  Safe, Effective, Robust and …Underutilized&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and drew critical &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cchrint.org/2013/07/02/another-assault-on-americas-children-electroshocking-kids-promoted-as-safe-effective/&#34;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; a week later (July 2) from Kelly Patricia O&amp;rsquo;Meara of CCHR International.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t spot any of this until last week, when it came up on the Twitter feed from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dxrevisionwatch&#34;&gt;DxRevision Watch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/peterkinderman&#34;&gt;Peter Kinderman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Involuntary Shock Treatment To Be Banned in Ireland</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/involuntary-shock-treatment-to-be-banned-in-ireland/</link>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/involuntary-shock-treatment-to-be-banned-in-ireland/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TallaTrialogue&#34;&gt;Talla Trialogue on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, I recently read an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thejournal.ie/electro-shock-therapy-unwilling-patients-ireland-983018-Jul2013/&#34;&gt;article in journal.ie&lt;/a&gt; on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Lynch, Minister of State for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People, has reportedly stated that &amp;ldquo;…the law will be changed so that unwilling patients will no longer be forced to receive ECT.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, if an individual refuses ECT, his refusal can be overridden by the signatures of two psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not everyone is in favor of the ban on forced ECT.  There&amp;rsquo;s an article by Marie Feely, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imn.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=4493:proposed-ban-on-involuntary-ect-criticised&amp;amp;catid=61:news&amp;amp;Itemid=28&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proposed ban on Involuntary ECT criticized &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;published in irishmedicalnews in January 2012.  The article reports on &lt;i&gt;a survey of consultant psychiatrists&lt;/i&gt; published in December 2011.  Ms. Feely writes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry Has the Moral High Ground (According to Jeffrey Lieberman)</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/psychiatry-has-the-moral-high-ground-according-to-jeffrey-lieberman/</link>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/psychiatry-has-the-moral-high-ground-according-to-jeffrey-lieberman/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I suppose everyone knows by now, psychiatry has been on the receiving end of some very serious criticism in recent years.  The criticism has come from many sources, including: survivors of psychiatric &amp;ldquo;treatment,&amp;rdquo; non-psychiatric mental health practitioners, journalists, the general public, and even from some psychiatrists themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the criticisms has been equally varied, and includes:  that the concept of mental illness is fundamentally spurious and devoid of explanatory significance; that psychiatric &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo; (i.e. drugging people) is ineffective, physically damaging and disempowering; that psychiatry has forged and continues to maintain corrupt and corrupting relationships with the pharmaceutical industry with regards to the peddling of drugs and the hijacking of research for commercial ends; etc…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tommymorrela&#34;&gt;Tommy Morrela&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, I&amp;rsquo;ve become aware of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellbeingfoundation.com/&#34;&gt;The Wellbeing Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.  They are located in Ireland.  Here are some quotes from their &lt;a href=&#34;http://wellbeingfoundation.com/aboutus.html&#34;&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;To call human suffering a disease, something pathological, is deluded. The biological model of psychological distress has no basis in science; it takes away from the equation between &#39;healer&#39;, sufferer and society the need for understanding, compassion, healing, prevention and social and political change. The medicalisation of problems of living has to stop. We have a collective duty of care to bring about the destruction of psychiatry in its present form.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come across an October 2012 article by Ted Chabasinski.  It&amp;rsquo;s on Mad in America and it&amp;rsquo;s called:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/10/our-task-is-to-take-away-the-power-of-psychiatry/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Task Is to Take Away the Power of Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted tells us that &lt;strong&gt;he was was subjected to electric shock &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo; when he was six years old&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can see a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/author/tchabasinski/&#34;&gt;brief bio here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes from the October 2012 article:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ECT – New and Improved?</title>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/ect-new-and-improved/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just come across a strange article on Mad in America.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;i&gt;Researchers look at therapeutic benefits of ketamine&lt;/i&gt;.  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=9956&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t identify an author, but it&amp;rsquo;s from the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening paragraph says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The largest trial into the use of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) in the UK in more than 30 years will look into how the use of the Class C drug ketamine might reduce the side effects of ECT for those being treated for severe depression.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Power of Words to Shape Attitudes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post called:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/19/do-major-tranquilizers-make-things-worse/&#34;&gt;Do Major Tranquilizers Make Things Worse?&lt;/a&gt;  The post was based on a study by Drs. Harrow and Jobe in which they speculated that the high relapse rate of &amp;ldquo;schizophrenics&amp;rdquo; who stop taking their drugs may have more to do with drug &lt;i&gt;withdrawal&lt;/i&gt; than the supposed drug efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, at BeyondMeds, pointed out that these drugs should not be called tranquilizers because some of their effects (e.g. akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, etc.) are anything but tranquil.  And this, of course, is a good point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shock &#34;Treatment&#34; Is Not Safe and Provides Little If Any Benefit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DELICATE THINGS REQUIRE DELICATE HANDLING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, one of my hobbies was making small transistor radios.  It sounds complicated, but is well within the reach of an average 15-year-old.  You get some magazine articles, learn how to read a circuit, and learn how to use a soldering iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transistor is a small device – about half the size of a pencil eraser – with three wires coming out of it.  In building a radio receiver, the transistors have to be soldered to other devices which are in turn soldered to other devices, etc…  The soldering iron is plugged into a wall outlet, but no mains electricity reaches the tip of the iron.  However, tiny eddy currents can circulate in the tip, and although they are only of the order of &lt;i&gt;milliamps&lt;/i&gt;, they can burn a transistor in seconds.  What you have to do is unplug the iron from the socket, make the joint with the tip&amp;rsquo;s retained heat, and then replug the iron to have it ready for the next joint.  The point being that &lt;i&gt;delicate things require delicate handling&lt;/i&gt;, and that &lt;strong&gt;electricity can be very destructive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
