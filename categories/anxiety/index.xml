      <title>Gender Wage Gap and Depression/Anxiety</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In their January 2016 issue, the journal Social Science and Medicine published &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26689629&#34;&gt;Unequal depression for equal work? How the wage gap explains gendered disparities in mood disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Jonathan Platt, MPH, Seth Prins, PhD candidate, Lisa Bates, PhD, and Katherine Keyes, PhD, MPH.  All the authors work at Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are more prevalent among women than men. This disparity may be partially due to the effects of structural gender discrimination in the work force, which acts to perpetuate gender differences in opportunities and resources and may manifest as the gender wage gap. We sought to quantify and operationalize the wage gap in order to explain the gender disparity in depression and anxiety disorders, using data from a 2001-2002 US nationally representative survey of 22,581 working adults ages 30-65. Using established Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methods to account for gender differences in individual-level productivity, our models reduced the wage gap in our sample by 13.5%, from 54% of men&#39;s pay to 67.5% of men&#39;s pay. We created a propensity-score matched sample of productivity indicators to test if the direction of the wage gap moderated the effects of gender on depression or anxiety. Where female income was less than the matched male counterpart, odds of both disorders were significantly higher among women versus men (major depressive disorder OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.95-3.04; generalized anxiety disorder OR: 4.11, 95% CI: 2.80-6.02). Where female income was greater than the matched male, the higher odds ratios for women for both disorders were significantly attenuated (Major Depressive Disorder OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.96-1.52) (Generalized Anxiety Disorder OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.04-2.29). The test for effect modification by sex and wage gap direction was statistically significant for both disorders. Structural forms of discrimination may explain mental health disparities at the population level. Beyond prohibiting overt gender discrimination, policies must be created to address embedded inequalities in procedures surrounding labor markets and compensation in the workplace.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepines: Disempowering and Dangerous</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepines-disempowering-and-dangerous/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;I recently read an article by Fredric Neuman, MD, Director of the Anxiety and Phobia Center at White Plains Hospital, NY.  The article is titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fighting-fear/201206/the-use-the-minor-tranquilizers-xanax-ativan-klonopin-and-valium&#34;&gt;The Use of the Minor Tranquilizers: Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and Valium&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; and was published in June 2012 by Psychology Today.  Thanks to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/medskep&#34;&gt;Medicalskeptic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; for the link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Neuman opens by telling us that benzodiazepines are &amp;ldquo;…very commonly prescribed for any sort of discomfort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepines – Adverse Effects</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepines-adverse-effects/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 25, Mad in America posted a link to an article in the Journal of Neurological Sciences.  The article is by Harnod et al, and is titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X13030384&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Association between Benzodiazepine Use and Occurrence of Benign Brain Tumors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The authors studied the records of  62,186 individuals in Taiwan  who had been prescribed a benzodiazepine for at least 2 months between 2000 and 2009.  They compared the incidence of brain tumors in these patients with the incidence in patients in a matched-pairs control group.  The hazard ratio for benign brain tumors (benzo group vs non-benzo group) was 3.15 (95% confidence interval: 2.37-4.20).  The hazard ratio for malignant brain tumors was 1.21 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-2.81).  What this means essentially is that one can be 95% confident that the benign tumor association is real, but that the malignant tumor result might have arisen by chance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I&#39;ve recently come across an article by Matt Samet called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/social-vacuum/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Social Vacuum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s dated March 2013, and was published on Robert Whitaker&#39;s website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Matt had been taking a benzodiazepine for some time, and while on a tapering withdrawal, he experienced some distressing symptoms, including some acute social discomfort.  (For a full account of benzo withdrawal –&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome&#34;&gt; click here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Is Not An Illness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was listening to NPR on the car radio.  The program was about so-called obsessive compulsive disorder, and a woman was describing her difficulty in this area.  I didn’t record her actual words, but it went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;I have all these checks and rituals that I have to do each day.  And it’s beginning to put a strain on my marriage.  Sometimes my husband wants to go somewhere but I can’t go until I finish my checks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Business As Usual</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/business-as-usual/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lane, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2010/04/15/the-so-called-mental-illnesses-are-not-illnesses/&#34;&gt;Shyness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has written an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light-benzodiazepine&#34;&gt;interesting post&lt;/a&gt;.  The gist of the matter is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines (benzos for short) that are promoted by Pharma and prescribed by psychiatrists to “treat” anxiety.  (As if anxiety were an illness!)  See my post on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2009/05/07/anxiety-disorders/&#34;&gt;So-called Anxiety Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzos include such household names as Valium, Librium, Ativan, Xanax, etc..  When introduced in the 1960’s, these drugs were widely touted as “safe” tranquilizers.  Readers may remember Valium as “mother’s little helper,” so called because it was marketed to millions of harried housewives as they struggled to adapt to an increasingly complex and multi-faceted lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DSM and Disability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every society in every generation makes errors.  Some of the errors are minor.  Some are major.  One of the great errors of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was this:  we accepted the spurious notion that a wide range of life’s problems were in fact &lt;em&gt;illnesses&lt;/em&gt;.  This spurious notion was initiated with good intentions – to provide shelter and humanitarian care for a relatively small number of individuals whose plight was truly dreadful.  But then the concept of mental illness took off, fuelled largely by the efforts of psychiatrists to legitimize their status as “real” doctors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Anxiety Disorders</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/anxiety-disorders/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fear is the &lt;em&gt;normal &lt;/em&gt;human response to imminent danger.  It is an adaptive response, in that it is helpful to survival, and it occurs in almost all animal species.  When our cave-dwelling ancestors were attacked by mountain lions, they probably experienced acute fear.  This fear gave them an extra burst of energy to flee the danger, or, if flight were impossible, to turn and fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today in most parts of the world, there is little danger of attack from wild animals.  As areas develop economically and culturally, these kinds of acute dangers are systematically eliminated or at least drastically reduced.  Close encounters with tornadoes, hurricanes, rattlesnakes, car accidents, etc., can still arouse full-blown fear responses, but most people in developed countries can go months – even years – without experiencing these kinds of situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
