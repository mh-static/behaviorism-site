      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two days ago, on July 9, Richard Lewis published on Mad in America a post in which he draws attention to the prolific worldwide prescribing of benzodiazepines, and the problems that this creates.  The article includes a music video of a song which Richard has written and performs.  The song is called Benzo Blue, and it &amp;ldquo;highlights the struggles of the millions of worldwide victims/survivors of prescribed benzodiazepine drugs such as Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and Valium.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 3 months since I have ingested any antidepressants or benzos. Almost died after drinking a large amount of vodka with the daily does of pills. Went to a rehab for a month and have been clean since. This is after over 27 years of benzos and prozac. I am 60 years old and am finally coming a awake. The Withdrawals, notably the restless leg and horrible cramping have been horrid at night, but I am totally committed to staying off the evil pills! Thanks for listening!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepines:  Miracle Drugs?</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepines-miracle-drugs/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2015 05:25:09 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first benzodiazepine – chlordiazepoxide – became available, from Hoffman-La Roche, in 1960, under the brand name Librium.  It was soon followed by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;diazepam (Valium) 1963;
nitrazepam (Mogadon) and oxazepam (Serax) in 1965;
temazepam (Restoril) 1969;
clorazepate (Tranxene) 1972;
flurazepam (Dalmane) 1973;
clonazepam (Klonopin) 1975;
lorazepam (Ativan) in 1977; and
alprazolam (Xanax) in 1981;
etc.&lt;/p&gt;
Benzodiazepines are categorized as sedative/hypnotics, which means that they have a relaxing, generally pleasant, sleep-inducing effect, and were embraced promptly by psychiatry for the &#34;treatment&#34; of anxiety, tension, worry, sleeplessness, etc.
&lt;p&gt;In this respect, the benzodiazepines largely replaced the earlier barbiturates, which had received a great deal of negative publicity because of their much publicized role in lethal overdoses, both accidental and intentional.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepine Withdrawal:  A Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepine-withdrawal-a-dilemma/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 05:15:47 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepine-withdrawal-a-dilemma/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 17, 2013, I wrote a post titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/03/17/withdrawal-from-benzodiazepines/&#34;&gt;Withdrawal from Benzodiazepines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  In that post I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Withdrawal from these drugs is potentially dangerous, incidentally, and medical supervision is a good idea, especially if the dependence is marked.  Try to find a physician other than the one who got you hooked on them in the first place.  In severe cases, hospitalization is required.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
On December 27, 2014, a reader (Nancy Rubenstein) left a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/03/17/withdrawal-from-benzodiazepines/#comment-1760716670&#34;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; which stated that this is dangerous advice in that  &#34;…there are literally less than a handful of doctors nationwide who have proven they can handle this. There is no safe hospitalisation for people in psych drug withdrawal…&#34;  Nancy also pointed out that when people do go to hospital for emergency withdrawal problems, they are often met with disbelief, and that this disbelief can result in further problems, e.g. diagnosis of a &#34;mental illness&#34;, further drugging, etc…
&lt;p&gt;All of these points are well taken, and I appreciate Nancy&amp;rsquo;s feedback.  I received similar feedback from Monica Cassani (&lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/&#34;&gt;Beyond Meds&lt;/a&gt;) in March of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepines and Aggression</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepines-and-aggression/</link>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepines-and-aggression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 19, 2014, the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry published &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Albrecht+Staiger%2C+Hall%2C+Miller+2014&#34;&gt;Benzodiazepine use and aggressive behaviour: A systematic review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;by Bonnie Albrecht et al, from Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the authors&amp;rsquo; conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;There appears to be a moderate association between some benzodiazepines and subsequent aggressive behaviour in humans. The circumstances under which aggressive responding may be more likely to follow benzodiazepine use remain unclear, although some evidence suggests dose and/or personality factors may influence this effect.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On September 9, 2014, the BMJ published an article by Sophie Billioti de Gage et al.  The article was titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/bmj.g5205-billioti-ALZ.pdf&#34;&gt;Benzodiazepine use and risk of Alzheimer’s disease: case-control study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and concluded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;“Benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;em&gt;The stronger association observed for long term exposures reinforces the suspicion of a possible direct association,&lt;/em&gt; even if benzodiazepine use might also be an early marker of a condition associated with an increased risk of dementia. Unwarranted long term use of these drugs should be considered as a public health concern.” [Emphasis added]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;I recently read an article by Fredric Neuman, MD, Director of the Anxiety and Phobia Center at White Plains Hospital, NY.  The article is titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fighting-fear/201206/the-use-the-minor-tranquilizers-xanax-ativan-klonopin-and-valium&#34;&gt;The Use of the Minor Tranquilizers: Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and Valium&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; and was published in June 2012 by Psychology Today.  Thanks to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/medskep&#34;&gt;Medicalskeptic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; for the link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Neuman opens by telling us that benzodiazepines are &amp;ldquo;…very commonly prescribed for any sort of discomfort.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepines:  Dangerous Drugs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;On February 25, Kristina Fiore published an article on MedPage today.  It&amp;rsquo;s titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medpagetoday.com/PainManagement/PainManagement/44481&#34;&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Killing Pain: Xanax Tops Charts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;The article is based on a study conducted by Jann M et al, and published in the February 2014 issue of the Journal of Pharmacy Practice.  The study is titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24436437&#34;&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Benzodiazepines: a major component in unintentional prescription drug overdoses with opioid analgesics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;&#34;During 2003 to 2009, the 2 prescriptions drugs with the highest increase in death rates were oxycodone 264.6% and alprazolam 233.8%. Therefore, benzodiazepines have a significant impact on prescription drug unintentional overdoses second only to the opioid analgesics. The combination prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics commonly takes place. The pharmacokinetic drug interactions between benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics are complex. The pharmacodynamic actions of these agents differ as their combined effects produce significant respiratory depression.&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepine Withdrawal</title>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzodiazepine-withdrawal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 28, I put up a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/11/28/benzodiazepines-adverse-effects/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including the potential for protracted and serious withdrawal problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve become aware of a helpful and interesting resource in this area.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/benzos/&#34;&gt;Benzo Info&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and is on Monica Cassani&amp;rsquo;s blog, &lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/&#34;&gt;BeyondMeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monica has first-hand experience of benzodiazepine withdrawal, and her comments and suggestions are always helpful, supportive, and insightful.  She also provides a comprehensive list of links to other materials dealing with specific aspects of this problem, including forums and support groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzodiazepines – Adverse Effects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 25, Mad in America posted a link to an article in the Journal of Neurological Sciences.  The article is by Harnod et al, and is titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X13030384&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Association between Benzodiazepine Use and Occurrence of Benign Brain Tumors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The authors studied the records of  62,186 individuals in Taiwan  who had been prescribed a benzodiazepine for at least 2 months between 2000 and 2009.  They compared the incidence of brain tumors in these patients with the incidence in patients in a matched-pairs control group.  The hazard ratio for benign brain tumors (benzo group vs non-benzo group) was 3.15 (95% confidence interval: 2.37-4.20).  The hazard ratio for malignant brain tumors was 1.21 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-2.81).  What this means essentially is that one can be 95% confident that the benign tumor association is real, but that the malignant tumor result might have arisen by chance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Melissa, a commenter on a recent post, asked if I would do a post on akathisia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akathisia literally means inability to sit.  People with this problem typically pace for long periods, and if they do sit down, they continue to keep moving and shifting their position in the chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In severity it can range from a generalized sense of uneasiness or agitation, to severe discomfort and even pain.  The discomfort tends to be located in the legs, but can also occur in the hip and pelvic area.  In severe cases, the victims pace to the point of exhaustion, but even then sitting does not relieve the discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Benzo Withdrawal: Another Story</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzo-withdrawal-another-story/</link>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/benzo-withdrawal-another-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another benzo withdrawal story on Mad in America:  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/reality-clash-when-benzo-withdrawal-meets-parenthood/&#34;&gt;The 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Mile: When Benzo Withdrawal Meets Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt; by Melissa Bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa recounts that when her Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome son was 18 months old and her baby daughter was three months, she consulted a physician because of problems with insomnia and consequent exhaustion.  He prescribed 2 mg of Ativan daily, which he increased to 6 mg within six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa describes in detail the problems of withdrawal, and the extreme measures she had to take to cope with this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More on Benzodiazepine Withdrawal</title>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-on-benzodiazepine-withdrawal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/03/17/withdrawal-from-benzodiazepines/#.UUknoxyG0eU&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; on this topic, I mentioned that benzo withdrawal can be dangerous, but it&amp;rsquo;s been drawn to my attention, by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, that perhaps I didn&amp;rsquo;t adequately stress &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; dangerous it can be in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click &lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/2012/01/21/benzodetoxdangers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, you can read Monica&amp;rsquo;s own account of her experience in a detox center in Florida.  It&amp;rsquo;s a thought-provoking article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because for many years benzos were dished out so liberally, there is still a &lt;strong&gt;mistaken perception that they are relatively safe and benign&lt;/strong&gt;, which is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&#39;ve recently come across an article by Matt Samet called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/social-vacuum/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Social Vacuum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s dated March 2013, and was published on Robert Whitaker&#39;s website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Matt had been taking a benzodiazepine for some time, and while on a tapering withdrawal, he experienced some distressing symptoms, including some acute social discomfort.  (For a full account of benzo withdrawal –&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome&#34;&gt; click here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Business As Usual</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/business-as-usual/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2011 15:44:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/business-as-usual/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lane, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2010/04/15/the-so-called-mental-illnesses-are-not-illnesses/&#34;&gt;Shyness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has written an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light-benzodiazepine&#34;&gt;interesting post&lt;/a&gt;.  The gist of the matter is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines (benzos for short) that are promoted by Pharma and prescribed by psychiatrists to “treat” anxiety.  (As if anxiety were an illness!)  See my post on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2009/05/07/anxiety-disorders/&#34;&gt;So-called Anxiety Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzos include such household names as Valium, Librium, Ativan, Xanax, etc..  When introduced in the 1960’s, these drugs were widely touted as “safe” tranquilizers.  Readers may remember Valium as “mother’s little helper,” so called because it was marketed to millions of harried housewives as they struggled to adapt to an increasingly complex and multi-faceted lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
