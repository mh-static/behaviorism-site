      <title>Dr. Pies&#39; Non-Apology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 23, 2020, Awais Aftab, MD, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Case Western, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/battle-soul-psychiatry-ronald-w-pies-md&#34;&gt;interviewed Ronald Pies, MD&lt;/a&gt;, also a psychiatrist, and a professor at Tufts and SUNY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interview, Dr. Aftab stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&#34;I have followed the controversy surrounding &#39;chemical imbalance&#39; with some interest over the years, including the multiple articles you have written on this issue. Generally, I agree with you that the chemical imbalance was never accepted as the &#39;truth&#39; by academic psychiatry or by our professional organizations. It was likely an advertisement strategy by pharmaceutical companies that took on a life of its own. However, I am not sure I am ready to exonerate our profession. At best, it seems like we were silent spectators, watching as this misleading idea spread like wildfire in the society (including among our patients and patient advocacy groups), doing little to nothing to correct these public misperceptions. At worst, it seems like at least some of us were participants. Ken Kendler writes in a 2019 &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; commentary, &#39;I would commonly see patients who would say some version of &#34;my psychiatrist said I have a chemical imbalance in my brain.&#34;&#39;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; I have had a very similar experience myself. Either way, surely as a profession, we could have done a better job of educating our patients and the public?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, the eminent and scholarly Ronald Pies, MD, psychiatrist, of SUNY Upstate Medical and Tufts Universities, has labored the point that psychiatry has never endorsed the simplistic chemical imbalance theory of &amp;ldquo;mental illness&amp;rdquo;.  As various anti-psychiatry bloggers, including myself, began to accumulate a great many instances of prominent psychiatrists doing just that, Dr. Pies began digging himself in on this particular topic.  In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823368_2&#34;&gt;Nuances, Narratives, and the &amp;ldquo;Chemical Imbalance&amp;rdquo; Debate&lt;/a&gt; (April 2014, Medscape), he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On September 9, 2020, Jonathan Stea, PhD, Tyler Black, MD, and Joseph Pierre, MD, published a piece on MedPage Today.  The article is titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.medpagetoday.com/psychiatry/generalpsychiatry/88526&#34;&gt;Why Anti-Psychiatry Now Fails and Harms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stea is a clinical psychologist and adjunct assistant professor at the University of Calgary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Black is the psychiatric medical director of British Columbia Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital.  He is also a clinical instructor in psychiatry at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Allen Frances: Still Spinning the Story</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/allen-frances-still-spinning-the-story/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 4, 2020, the very eminent Allen Frances, MD, published an article in Aeon, which according to its &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/about&#34;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;a digital magazine, publishing some of the most profound and provocative thinking on the web. We ask the big questions and find the freshest, most original answers, provided by leading thinkers on science, philosophy, society and the arts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/ideas/the-lure-of-cool-brain-research-is-stifling-psychotherapy&#34;&gt;The lure of ‘cool’ brain research is stifling psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  The central theme is that prior to 1990, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) &amp;ldquo;appreciated the need for a well-rounded approach [to mental health] and maintained a balanced research budget that covered an extraordinarily wide range of topics and techniques.&amp;rdquo;  However, since 1990, the opening year of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_of_the_Brain&#34;&gt;Decade of the Brain&lt;/a&gt;, the NIMH has &amp;ldquo;increasingly narrowed its focus almost exclusively to brain biology – leaving out everything else that makes us human, both in sickness and in health.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Chemical Imbalance Theory of Depression: Where Is It Going?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The spurious chemical imbalance theory of depression is arguably the most destructive thing that psychiatry has ever done.  Worldwide, millions of individuals are taking antidepressants, often with a cocktail of other drugs, because they have been told the blatant falsehood that they need the pills to combat a brain illness – a &amp;ldquo;real illness just like diabetes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these individuals were told the additional lie that they needed to take the pills for life and are now addicted to the products.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Chemical Imbalance Theory.  Dr. Pies Returns, Again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 30, 2019, the very eminent and learned psychiatrist Ronald Pies, MD, published a piece in Psychiatric Times titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/depression/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again&#34;&gt;Debunking the Two Chemical Imbalance Myths, Again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the opening paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Like the legendary Count Dracula, who could be killed only by driving a stake through his heart, some myths seem almost immortal. For more than eight years now, I have tried to drive a stake through the heart of two myths regarding the so-called &#39;chemical imbalance theory&#39;&lt;sup&gt;1-3&lt;/sup&gt;—but with only limited success, as a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-challenge-of-going-off-psychiatric-drugs&#34;&gt;piece in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brought home to me.&lt;sup&gt;4&#34;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 18, 2015, Dr. Pies sent his response to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2015/11/my-response-to-dr-pies/&#34;&gt;November 17 article&lt;/a&gt; to MIA.  MIA posted it, and forwarded a copy to me.  It reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have read Dr. Philip Hickey’s 8400+ word treatise, and I have only the following to say with regard to the two key points at issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Notwithstanding my omission of quotation marks in my original Medscape article [1]—for which I take responsibility—the fact remains: I have never believed or argued that the so-called chemical imbalance theory (which was never really a theory) is merely a “little white lie.” It is that point of view—not merely typed words on the page—that has been falsely and carelessly attributed to me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have never received a dime from any pharmaceutical company or private agency with any verbal or written understanding that I would “promote” (elevate, popularize, hype, etc.) a particular drug. If any of the papers I wrote or co-authored over a decade ago had the effect of putting a drug in a favorable light, it was because the best scientific evidence available at that time supported the drug’s benefit. Nothing in Philip Hickey’s belaboring of half-truths, innuendos and guilt by association demonstrates otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Behavioar-Therapist-Oct-2015.pdf&#34;&gt;October 2015 issue of the Behavior Therapist&lt;/a&gt; (pages 206-213), Jeffrey Lacasse, PhD, and Jonathan Leo, PhD, published an article titled &lt;em&gt;Antidepressants and the Chemical Imbalance Theory of Depression: A Reflection and Update on the Discourse&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the article had particular merit, and I drew attention to it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2015/11/02/more-on-the-chemical-imbalance-theory/&#34;&gt;a post dated November 2&lt;/a&gt;.  The post, &lt;em&gt;More on the Chemical Imbalance Theory, &lt;/em&gt;was also &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2015/11/more-on-the-chemical-imbalance-theory/&#34;&gt;published on Mad in America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that post, I quoted a number of passages from the Behavior Therapist article, including:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dr. Pies and Psychiatry&#39;s &#39;Solid Center&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ronald Pies, MD, is one of American&amp;rsquo;s most eminent and prestigious psychiatrists.  He is the Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of Psychiatric Times, and he is a Professor of Psychiatry at both Syracuse and Tufts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with many of Dr. Pies&amp;rsquo; contentions, and I have expressed these disagreements in detail in various posts (for instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2014/06/06/psychiatry-did-promote-the-chemical-imbalance-theory/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2015/04/02/453-psychiatric-diagnoses-labels-not-explanations/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2014/09/08/dr-pies-still-spinning/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  But there is one area where I have to acknowledge Dr. Pies&amp;rsquo; efforts:  he never gives up in his defense of his beloved psychiatry, even in the face of the most damaging counter-evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugh Middleton, MD, posted  an interesting article on Mad in America, October 1, 2015.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2015/10/hey-dont-just-shoot-the-messenger/&#34;&gt;Hey; Don&amp;rsquo;t Just Shoot the Messenger!&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;  Dr. Middleton is a British psychiatrist who  is a founding member of the Critical Psychiatry Network, and was a co-author of the cardinal paper, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5cLaT3gdm9NMTF2MVBfU1paOUk/edit&#34;&gt;Psychiatry beyond the current paradigm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (2012).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Middleton had attended a conference in London on September 18.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://cepuk.org/2015/06/11/london-18-sep-harm-good-confronting-psychiatric-medication-epidemic/&#34;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; had been organized by the Council for Evidence-based Psychiatry in order to address the topic:  &amp;ldquo;the iatrogenic harm caused by the over-prescription of psychiatric medications.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Book Review:  &lt;b&gt;Depression Delusion&lt;/b&gt;, by Terry Lynch, MD, MA</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/book-review-b-depression-delusion-b-by-terry-lynch-md-ma/</link>

      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/book-review-b-depression-delusion-b-by-terry-lynch-md-ma/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this truly remarkable, and meticulously researched, volume, Dr. Lynch annihilates psychiatry&amp;rsquo;s cherished chemical imbalance theory of depression.  Every facet of this theory, which the author correctly calls a delusion, is critically analyzed and found wanting.  Example after example is provided of psychiatrists promoting this fiction, the factual and logical errors of which are clearly exposed in Dr. Lynch&amp;rsquo;s lucid, seamless, and highly readable prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book runs to 343 pages, and is laden with factual details, case studies, alternative perspectives, and hard-hitting commentary.  Dr. Lynch does not sit on the sidelines, nor does he seek any kind of collegial compromise with the chemical imbalance theory, which he unambiguously denounces as a groundless and destructive falsehood.  Here are some quotes that I think will convey something of the content, style, and cogency of this vitally important work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 5, 2015, Scott Alexander, MD, a trainee psychiatrist, posted an article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/05/chemical-imbalance/&#34;&gt;Chemical Imbalance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on his website Slate Star Codex.  (The writer tells us that Scott Alexander is a blog handle and not his real name, but for convenience, I will refer to him as Dr. Alexander.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alexander begins by noting that there have been a number of articles recently that have criticized psychiatry for &amp;ldquo;botching the &amp;lsquo;chemical imbalance&amp;rsquo; theory.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Chemical Imbalance Theory:  Still Being Promoted</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/the-chemical-imbalance-theory-still-being-promoted/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2014 05:30:44 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/the-chemical-imbalance-theory-still-being-promoted/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 28, Psychiatric Times published an article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/print/202470&#34;&gt;Psychiatric Diagnosis and Treatment of Somatizing Neuropsychiatric Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  The authors are Daniel T. Williams, MD, and Alla Landa PhD, both from Columbia University Psychiatry Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article&amp;rsquo;s lead-in states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Although the somatizing disorders cover a vast array of symptomatic domains across many medical specialties, this article addresses the broad topic conceptually.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
The so-called somatizing disorders have an interesting history in psychiatry.  DSM-III-R (1987) states:
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The essential features of this group of disorders are physical symptoms suggesting physical disorder (hence, Somatoform) for which there are no demonstrable organic findings or known physiologic mechanisms, and for which there is positive evidence, or a strong presumption, that the symptoms are linked to psychological factors or conflicts.&#34; (p 255)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 1, the very eminent psychiatrist Ronald Pies, MD, wrote an article for Psychiatric Times titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/positivism-humanism-and-case-psychiatric-diagnosis/page/0/3&#34;&gt;Positivism, Humanism and the Case for Psychiatric Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  The article also appeared in Medscape on August 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pies begins by discussing websites &amp;ldquo;…that critically examine psychiatry.&amp;rdquo;  These websites, he tells us,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;…vary from the viscerally enraged, to the politely skeptical, to the constructively critical, and everything in between. The worst antipsychiatry Web sites, in my view, are veritable bastions of bigotry, in which psychiatrists are subjected to invective and abuse that would never be tolerated if directed, say, at some ethnic or racial minority.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Psychiatric &#39;Myth&#39; Debunking</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 15, I wrote a post called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2014/07/15/psychiatry-debunks-the-myths/&#34;&gt;Psychiatry Debunks the &amp;lsquo;Myths.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  In that article I focused on the myth-debunking of Cognitive Psychiatry of Chapel Hill, but in researching the topic for that post, I came across a psychiatry resident named Shan (no last name) who blogs on a website called E&lt;em&gt;xploratory Encephalotomy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to the name of the website, Dr. Shan explains on his &lt;a href=&#34;http://encephalotomy.com/about-the-blog/&#34;&gt;About the blog&lt;/a&gt; page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;…&#39;exploratory encephalotomy&#39; implies opening up somebody’s brain in order to search for something.  To the best of my knowledge, it’s not a real medical procedure yet…&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry Debunks the &#39;Myths&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;Psychiatry has always had its share of critics, but in the past two decades these criticisms have increased in frequency and intensity.  Psychiatry&#39;s underlying concepts are being denounced as spurious to the point of inanity, and its practices are being accurately and forcefully exposed as destructive, disempowering, and stigmatizing.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry has no rational or logical response to these criticisms.  Its leadership and its rank and file remain stubbornly blind to the arbitrariness and invalidity of its so-called diagnoses, the unquestioning adoption of which distorts their perceptions of people and their problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry DID Promote the Chemical Imbalance Theory</title>
      <link>https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/psychiatry-did-promote-the-chemical-imbalance-theory/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 15, Ronald Pies, MD, an eminent and widely published psychiatrist, wrote an article for Medscape.com.  The piece is titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823368&#34;&gt;Nuances, Narratives, and the &amp;lsquo;Chemical Imbalance&amp;rsquo; Debate in Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thrust of the article is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;…the &#39;chemical imbalance theory&#39; was never a real theory, nor was it widely propounded by responsible practitioners in the field of psychiatry.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
This is not the first time that Dr. Pies has made this claim,  On July 11, 2011, he wrote an article for Psychiatric Times titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blogs/couch-crisis/psychiatry-new-brain-mind-and-legend-chemical-imbalance&#34;&gt;Psychiatry’s New Brain-Mind and the Legend of the “Chemical Imbalance.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  In that article he wrote:
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;In truth, the ‘chemical imbalance’ notion was always a kind of urban legend- – never a theory seriously propounded by well-informed psychiatrists.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
