      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of psychiatry&amp;rsquo;s most obvious vulnerabilities is the fact that various so-called antidepressant drugs induce homicidal and suicidal feelings and actions in some people, especially late adolescents and young adults.  This fact is not in dispute, but psychiatry routinely downplays the risk, and insists that the benefits of these drugs outweigh any risks of actual violence that might exist.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article in the current issue of the National Psychologist written by David Kirschner, PhD, a New York psychologist.  The National Psychologist is a newspaper-type magazine that publishes articles of general interest to psychologists and others working in this field.  Most issues contain a mix of opinion pieces, news, changes in government regulations, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirschner&amp;rsquo;s article is titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nationalpsychologist.com/2014/09/mass-shooters-received-only-limited-treatment/102638.html&#34;&gt;Mass shooters received only limited treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;On December 27, 2013, Connecticut State Police issued a 7,000-page, heavily redacted, report on the massacre that occurred at Sandy Hook Elementary School just over a year earlier (December 14, 2012).  For the record, I have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; read the 7,000-page report, but I have read the Wikipedia article &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting&#34;&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;, last updated January 4, 2013, and several media reports on the matter, including reports from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/nyregion/with-release-of-final-sandy-hook-shooting-report-investigation-is-said-to-be-over.html?hpw&amp;amp;rref=nyregion&amp;amp;_r=0&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.courant.com/2013-12-28/news/hc-lanza-sandy-hook-report1228-20131227_1_peter-lanza-adam-lanza-nancy-lanza&#34;&gt;Hartford Courant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/police-file-to-be-released-on-newtown-shooting/2013/12/27/36612944-6ec5-11e3-a5d0-6f31cd74f760_story.html&#34;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Another Mass Shooting: Link to SSRIs?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mass murder occurred yesterday, September 16, at the U.S. Navy Yard in Washington D.C.  There are reports of at least 12 dead, and several wounded.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.yahoo.com/contract-worker-behind-navy-yard-shooting-rampage-111847531.html&#34;&gt;Early news stories&lt;/a&gt; describe the perpetrator as having &amp;ldquo;mental issues,&amp;rdquo; and it is reported that he &amp;ldquo;…had been &lt;strong&gt;treated since August by the Veterans Administration for his mental problems&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;  It is likely that this &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo; involved the prescription of psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still no government inquiry into the &lt;strong&gt;link between psycho-pharmaceutical products, especially SSRI&amp;rsquo;s, and acts of violence/suicide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
