      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the current issue of Clinical Psychology Review (April 8, 2013), you will find a very interesting article by Brett Jason Deacon, PhD, who is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Wyoming.  The article is called &lt;i&gt;The Biomedical Model of Mental Disorder: A Critical Analysis of its Tenets, Consequences, and Effects on Psychotherapy Research&lt;/i&gt;.  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deacon-biomedical-model-and-stigma-2013.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is a critique of the biomedical model from a theoretical and a practical perspective.  The author has managed to elucidate a comprehensive range of criticisms of the biomedical model, and has blended them together into a coherent and compelling account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
