      <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning I received an email from Oldhead, who has been active in opposing the Murphy Bill.  Here are two quotes from the email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;As succinctly as possible -- the main language from MURPHY (including AOT funding) has been consolidated with another bill, the 21ST CENTURY CURES bill, which is being introduced as a House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 34, Tsunami Warning, Education and Research Act of 2015.&#39;  In other words, Murphy is being slipped through on another bill’s coattails, if Murphy, Jaffee &amp;amp; Co. have their say.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
