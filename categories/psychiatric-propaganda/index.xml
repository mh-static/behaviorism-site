      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the May 2014 issue of The Costco Connection, which is published by Costco Wholesale.  This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a copy of this magazine, and I would describe it as a catalog/lifestyle periodical. There are lots of ads for Costco&amp;rsquo;s own products, and the articles are wide ranging, topical, and easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular issue was drawn to my attention because on page 57, there&amp;rsquo;s an article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.costcoconnection.com/connection/201405?pg=60#pg60&#34;&gt;Blues Clues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  The subtitle is:  &amp;ldquo;Physical pain is one of the unexpected signs of depression.&amp;rdquo;   The author is Jodi Helmer, a freelance journalist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
