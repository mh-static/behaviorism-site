      <description>&lt;p&gt;Post edited and updated March 9, 2013, to reflect additional thoughts as a result of interactions with the many people who left comments. I thank them for their input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEPRESSION – AN ADAPTIVE MECHANISM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the APA’s assertion, depression is not an illness. In fact, depression is an adaptive mechanism which has served humanity well for millions of years. When things are going well in our lives, we feel good. This good feeling is nature’s way of telling us to keep doing what we’re doing. When our lives are not going well, we feel down or depressed. This is nature’s way of telling us to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
