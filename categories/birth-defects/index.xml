      <description>&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Nanu Grewal in Australia, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across this interesting paper:Â  &lt;a href=&#34;http://anp.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/06/11/0004867413492219.abstract&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Systematic meta-analysis of individual selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications and congenital malformations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Nicholas Myles et al.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note that there is some suggestion of a link between SSRI&amp;rsquo;s, as a group, and birth defects, but that the teratogenicity of individual members of this drug class have not been systematically compared by meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis is essentially a systematic review of previous studies and combining of the results of those that meet certain pre-determined criteria for research quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
