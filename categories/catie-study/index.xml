      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAFE Study, conducted by Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, et al between 2002 and 2005, has been the subject of much comment.  Carl Elliott, in particular, has written extensively on the matter, including his article &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/dan-markingson-drug-trial-astrazeneca?page=1&#34;&gt;The Deadly Corruption of Clinical Trials&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in Mother Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to address the issues involved in the CAFE study, we must first take a brief look at the CATIE study.  This was also conducted by Dr. Lieberman et al (not the same et al as CAFE, but with some overlap).  CATIE was conducted between 2001 and 2004.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
