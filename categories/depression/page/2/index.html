    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In this truly remarkable, and meticulously researched, volume, Dr. Lynch annihilates psychiatry’s cherished chemical imbalance theory of depression. Every facet of this theory, which the author correctly calls a delusion, is critically analyzed and found wanting. Example after example is provided of psychiatrists promoting this fiction, the factual and logical errors of which are clearly exposed in Dr. Lynch’s lucid, seamless, and highly readable prose.
The book runs to 343 pages, and is laden with factual details, case studies, alternative perspectives, and hard-hitting commentary. Dr. Lynch does not sit on the sidelines, nor does he seek any kind of collegial compromise with the chemical imbalance theory, which he unambiguously denounces as a groundless and destructive falsehood. Here are some quotes that I think will convey something of the content, style, and cogency of this vitally important work.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p> No, I’ve never used the services of psychologists, never took a “pill.” But I have felt under sudden Depression and Anxiety, like any of you. Self awareness is necessary. To know when you are not acting “normal.” If we keep hoping for something to happen in an unrealistic way, on denial, and at the end of the journey we cannot achieve that goal, DEPRESSION hits… How do I beat it? Redirecting my mind to most realistic goals. Recharging my mind with optimism, remembering the beautiful things we have achieved already. Admiring Nature, the smile of a kid: LOVING. Exercises help. Art too. The most important thing? Think you have come to this world with a purpose. Think you can help others. Feel like a champion who can accomplish everything. And stay away from medication: The cure is inside you, in your mind, in your soul… Be strong! YOU ARE STRONGER THAN WHAT YOU THINK!!!!

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Depression:  A Different Perspective
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I have recently come across an interesting paper: How to Understand and then Escape from Depression. It’s written by Saul Youssef, a professor of physics at Boston University.
The central theme of the paper is that persistent or chronic depression is caused by “…an unconscious withdrawal of participation in a person’s own internal decision making processes.”
Here are some quotes:
&#34;I have been depressed for most of my life, and, at various times, I have tried most of the recommended treatments for depression. I have tried Saint John’s Wort, exercise, Yoga, talk therapy, SSRIs, thyroid supplements and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. In my case, I would say that thyroid supplements, exercise and Yoga helped the most and all of them helped at least a little bit. Unfortunately, none of these treatments helped dramatically. Then, however, in late 2013 and early 2014, I finally figured it out. I came to understand what was happening in my own head and why it was causing my own depression and I was able to figure out a way to escape. I don’t mean that I am now successfully managing my depression. I mean it’s gone. I am writing up what I think is going on and what I did to escape because I don’t think that my case is unusual. I think that exactly the same thing will work for many people.&#34;

&#34;The finding that in-patient care for depression did not increase the probability of the detection of antidepressants in suicides is difficult to explain other than by the assumption that a substantial number of depressed individuals were saved from suicide by postdischarge treatment with antidepressant medication.&#34;

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I am 46 years old and have taken antidepressants (Lexapro, Paxil, now Zoloft) for 10 years. But the reason I began taking them wasn’t due to my own need for relief from depression or anxiety. It was actually an effort to improve my relationship with my husband at the time. He suffered from depression and took medication, but said that I was overly critical, driven, intense, etc. and I think he was right. But I was also young and immature, and am an engineer by profession. I do have a critical thought process, no doubt. We were mismatched from the start and separated not long after I started the medication, but have a 11 year old son together. The divorce process, and going back to work full time as a single mom was difficult and stressful. But after taking the Lexapro for over 4 years, I actaully began feeling lethargic and depressed and decided to stop taking it cold turkey. Big mistake, I learned the hard way, and ended up on Paxil after a few months. Now I am having the same problem with the Paxil, and I really just want to get off the medication all together because I feel that it is causing the depression. I was never depressed to begin with, but now I am! After a couple of bad experiences with withdrawal symptoms from coming off the meds, I am really apprehensive about trying to taper off of them, but I want myself back, not this medicated, lethargic, irritable, unproductive person. I was far from perfect, as my ex-husband made painfully clear, but I always had hope for a better future and energy to work for it. I can’t help but feel that the meds have done more harm than good in my particular situation. I just wonder if others have had similar experiences? Thank you and best wishes in whatever you are searching for…

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was searching Google for effects of propaganda on the human psych, and stumbled upon this site. After reading a few stories, I felt I had to share my own. When I was in high school I was depressed. To the point where I was a walking text book definition. Failing grades, poor hygiene, isolation. All the signs were obvious.I had to go to rehab for drinking too much cough syrup.When I went to the doctor he diagnosed me with ADHD. I have never been a hyper person. always rather slow and calm.Than he tells me that he is going to just experiment with multiple drugs to see what works, and than diagnose me with whatever that drug treats.First drug was Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate)Its a new “abuse-free” amphetamine. Due to a coating of protein, the chemical can only dissolve in your stomach acid. Injecting, Smoking, or Snorting would not activate it.However the prescribed dose taken once a day was enough to make me a full effect of amphetamines, and I began losing alot of sleep. After having multiple panic attacks on this medication, I demanded the doctor take me off of it.He than gave me Focalin (Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride)Another new “abuse-free” drug. During my younger years I experimented with MDMA, and I would compare the feeling of Focalin with that of Extacy.When I got into college my doctor pulled me off of it saying that college kids are more likely to sell it, and that he must change my prescription.Next drug was Strattera (atomoxetine). I threw up every time I took it. It gave me intense piriods of happiness followed by extreme bursts of anger for no reason at all.I stopped going to the doctor, I stopped taking medications. I no longer trust the medical system, the pharm companies, or even the government. I’d rather suffer the depression untreated than go through what I went through in high school.On a side note, The experience made me drop out of school, and get my GED. That year, my school experienced a higher drop out rate than ever before.
