    <p>We’ve all known for a long time that neuroleptic drugs damage brain cells. But now it seems clear that they also increase the risk of osteoporosis and consequently bone fractures.
There’s an article about this in the International Journal of Endocrinology, dated March 2013. It’s titled Osteoporosis Associated with Antipsychotic Treatment in Schizophrenia, and was written by Haishan Wu et al, from the Central South University in Changsha, China. I came upon the article through Robert Whitaker’s site Mad in America.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>BACKGROUND
On March 19 of this year an article by Martin Harrow and Thomas Jobe was published in the Schizophrenia Bulletin: Does Long-Term Treatment of Schizophrenia with Antipsychotic Medications Facilitate Recovery? You can see it here. The term “antipsychotics” embraces drugs such as Haldol, Risperdal, Thorazine, etc… I prefer the term major tranquilizers, because it is more accurate.
Drs. Harrow and Job have conducted a long-term (15-20 year) study of people diagnosed with the condition known as schizophrenia. They found that individuals who had been given “anti-psychotics” continuously for these long periods showed “…considerable psychopathology and few sustained periods of recovery.”

    <p>I’ve recently come across (courtesy of Tallaght Trialogue) an article in Current Psychiatry (Feb 2013) on this topic. The author is Henry A. Nasrallah, M.D., and you can see it here.
Dr. Nasrallah, who is Editor-in-Chief of Current Psychiatry, states that there are 273 bio-markers for schizophrenia. But wait. Dr. Nasrallah goes on to say:
&#34;None of the individual 273 biomarkers alone can serve as a diagnostic tool for the schizophrenias because there will be high rates of false positives and false negatives.&#34;

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>First story
In the early 70’s I worked in Grendon Prison in England. The facility was run on the lines of a therapeutic community – lots of meetings, groups, etc… One of the prisoners – let’s call him William – was serving time for burglary. He was about 24 years old, and during his intake interviews he told us that he was a member of a small quasi-religious sect who believed that doomsday was imminent and that they would be the chosen few. He talked about these matters openly and with a good measure of passion, and after a few weeks the other prisoners were describing him as “crazy” and a “nutcase.”

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Years ago I was director of a county mental health center in an Eastern state. Shortly after taking the position, I became concerned that clients were being involuntarily committed too readily and without exploration of other options. I issued an instruction that all such activity had to be approved by a middle manager before it could proceed. This measure aroused enormous resistance from the front-line staff.
There was one client – let’s call him Charlie – who was committed to the State Hospital every year, usually in July. Every July, he would become “agitated,” would scream profanities at his elderly mother, and break things around the house. He carried a “diagnosis” of schizophrenia.

    <p>Until just a few years ago, the spurious nature of mental illness received little or no attention either in professional circles or in the general media. There were a few of us “cranks” who poked away at the issue, but peer condemnation was usually swift and outspoken. On one occasion I was called an “anti-science Nazi” for daring to suggest that the condition known as ADHD might have more to do with ineffective parental discipline than with brain chemistry. We were voices in the wilderness.

    <p>As most readers of this website are aware, there is a great deal of resistance to the soon-to-be-released DSM-5. There is even a Boycott DSM-5 Committee established by Jack Carney, and many people are suggesting that practitioners use the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) instead.
In the general context of this debate, I have come across an article by Philip Thomas, M.D. – “Pinball Wizards and the Doomed Project of Psychiatric Diagnosis.&#34; Dr. Thomas points out that “…it’s hard to imagine that the criticisms raised about DSM-5 won’t also apply to the ICD.”

    <p>Jay Joseph, PhD has posted an interesting piece: “Five Decades of Gene Finding Failures in Psychiatry” on Mad in America (Robert Whitaker’s site). It is well worth a read. The general content of the article is clear from the title.
Here are some quotes:
&#34;Two generations of molecular genetic researchers have attempted, yet failed, to discover the genes that they believe underlie the major psychiatric disorders.&#34;
&#34;Despite the sequencing of the human genome and the publication of more than 1,700 schizophrenia molecular genetic studies, we have witnessed over 40 years of gene finding claims, and over 40 years of subsequently non-replicated findings.&#34;

    <p>Late adolescence and early adulthood is arguably the most difficult period of life. Transitioning from childhood to adulthood entails many challenges. The young person (male or female) is expected to emancipate successfully from parents; launch a career; and find a partner – all in the space of a few short years.
Some individuals cope remarkably well. Others squeak through, and a small minority “crash and burn.” The latter group usually return home.
