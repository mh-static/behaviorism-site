      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been some discussion in recent weeks concerning the role of childhood abuse in the etiology of the condition known as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly difficult to address this problem because the condition known as schizophrenia is not a unified phenomenon.  Rather, it is an assortment of loosely clustered behaviors which has been falsely and illogically labeled by the APA as an illness, existing in an individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question &amp;ldquo;Is schizophrenia caused by childhood abuse?&amp;rdquo; is a meaningless question. In other words, it cannot be answered either as &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;false.&amp;rdquo;  In fact, it can&amp;rsquo;t even be answered &amp;ldquo;maybe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
