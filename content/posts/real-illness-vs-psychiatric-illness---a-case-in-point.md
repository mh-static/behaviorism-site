<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">On Monday, February 17, cannotsay, a regular commenter on this website, left a link to a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/order-justice-department-investigate-civil-rights-violations-justina-pelletier-case/7s77z28f">White House petition</a> on a recent post.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The petition calls for an investigation into possible civil rights violations in the case of Justina Pelletier, 15, who is being held by court order in a residential unit in Framingham, Massachusetts.  The issue is complicated and contentious.  The psychiatrists apparently maintain that she has a psychiatric "illness" (somatoform pain disorder), whereas her parents and other physicians say that she suffers from mitochondrial disease.  Wikipedia has an article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_disease">mitochondrial disease</a>.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">There's also a comprehensive <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/advocates-fight-teen-justin-pelletier-held-state-pysch/story?id=22312907">ABC News article</a> on Justina's case.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I'm a little uncomfortable with the wording of the petition, in that it begins with the assertion that "…patients and, in the case of a minor, their parents are the final authority in determining their medical treatment."  As a general principle, I support this contention, but there are rare occasions in which parents, for reasons of their own, deny a child treatment even in the face of life-threatening illness.  However, nothing of this sort seems to be happening in this case, and the call for an investigation has obvious merit.  I encourage readers to take a look at the issues, and consider signing the petition.</span>
