The FDA recently approved paroxetine (which in higher doses is marketed as the antidepressant Paxil) as a nonhormonal treatment for hot flashes in menopausal women.  The drug will be marketed as Brisdelle.

According to a New York Times article <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/business/fda-approves-a-drug-for-hot-flashes.html?_r=0">F.D.A. Approves a Drug for Hot Flashes</a>, </i>the approval was granted despite the fact that FDA's own advisory committee voted 10 to 4 last March <i>against approval.</i>

The reported reason for the negative vote was that in clinical trials, <strong>Brisdelle proved only minimally effective</strong>.

Brisdelle apparently will be marketed with an "increased risk of suicidal thoughts and actions"  label, but I wonder how many women who take the product will realize that they are taking a low dose of Paxil?
