After <a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2015/08/10/an-invitation-to-debate/">Monday's post</a>, I received the following tweet from Dr. Huda:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Dear @BigPhilHickey I find debates over Twitter r largely pointless I am (slowly) writing a book outlining my views"</p>
To which I reply:
<ol>
	<li>I never suggested a debate over Twitter. In fact, I stated very clearly that  "… Twitter, while an excellent medium for certain kinds of communication, is not a suitable vehicle for serious debate."</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>This entire matter was started by Dr. Huda's assertion on Twitter that I hate psychiatry, and that I get its concepts wrong.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>In response, I invited Dr. Huda  "… to critique any of my writings – to set out which of psychiatry’s concepts I 'get wrong', and to point out the flaws in my analysis."</li>
</ol>
I also made the point that Dr. Huda's original tweet was a way of avoiding the issues.  Today's follow-up tweet strikes me as more of the same.

So, at the risk of laboring the point, let me make myself perfectly clear.  I am inviting – indeed encouraging – Dr. Huda to critique any of my writings.  They can be found at <a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/">Behaviorism and Mental Health</a>.  He may write his critique anywhere he chooses, and if he will let me know where it can be found, I promise to reply.
