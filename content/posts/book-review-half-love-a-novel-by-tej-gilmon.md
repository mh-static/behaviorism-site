I have recently read a remarkable novel with a strong anti-psychiatry theme.  It is titled:  <em>Half Love</em>.  The author, Tej Gilmon, is a psychiatric nurse from California who enjoys video gaming and watching the Giants whenever he can.

If this were a movie, it would probably be rated R.

The novel, which runs to 356 pages, is set in the future (about 2190).  Life expectancies are well past 100.

There are freighters carrying materials mined on Mars, and couples go to the Moon for introductory, pre-wedding vacations.

A new version of psychiatry's infamous chemical imbalance has been "identified", promoted, and become extremely profitable for the treatment of a newly discovered mental illness called SLUG (Syndrome of Lassitude and Ulterior Gestalt), which is afflicting large segments of the population.

The action takes place on the Moon, in transit back to Earth, and in California.

Genre:  Sci-fi; Rom-Com; Anti-psychiatry; but essentially genre-defying.

More than this I cannot divulge, for fear of spoiling the story.

The author has made the work available free as an ebook which can be accessed here in pdf format:  <a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/eNovel-_Half-Love_.pdf">Half Love</a>
