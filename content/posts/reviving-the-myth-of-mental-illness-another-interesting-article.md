I’ve just read <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/07/reviving-the-myth-of-mental-illness/"><em>Reviving the Myth of Mental Illness</em></a> by Steven Morgan.  This article appeared in the Personal Stories section of Robert Whitaker’s website <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/"><strong>Mad in America</strong></a>, and is well worth reading.

Here are some quotes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Thus, it is important to note that mental illness in itself – the idea that a mind is ill, is actually a categorical error, like saying the sky is ill or the color green is healthy. "</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"…there is not a single reliable test for any of the 297 disorders listed in the current diagnostic manual…"</p>
Of particular relevance is the fact that Steven Morgan isn’t just <em>writing</em> about these matters, he is also the Executive Director of <a href="http://www.anotherwayvt.org/">Another Way</a>, a community center for psychiatric survivors, and is Project Developer for <a href="http://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/sites/dmh/files/About/Soteria_VT_One_Page_Info_Letter_8_22_2012.pdf">Soteria-VT</a>.
