Subject: Misstatements in Philip Hickey\'s blog Echo Misstatements by Lacasse &amp; Leo</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Message sent by: Ronald Pies MD</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Message:Dear Mr. Cole:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Philip Hickey\'s blog, \"More on the Chemical Imbalance Theory\"—posted on your website—references a recent paper by Lacasse &amp; Leo (\"Antidepressants and the Chemical Imbalance Theory of Depression\") which contains incorrect and misleading information re: my views, as well as an unsupported claim re: supposed “conflicts of interest”  Lacasse &amp; Leo impute to me. These misstatements by Lacasse &amp; Leo are, unfortunately, repeated in Hickey\'s blog.  This is unacceptable and must be publicly corrected. In brief, Lacasse and Leo’s misrepresentations are as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. They misattribute the phrase “little white lie” to me, with regard to the so-called “chemical imbalance theory.” In reality, this unfortunate phrase was originally used by Mr. Robert Whitaker in an interview with Bruce Levine. The link is: <a href="http://brucelevine.net/psychiatry-admits-its-been-wrong-in-big-ways-but-can-it-change-a-chat-with-robert-whi/">http://brucelevine.net/psychiatry-admits-its-been-wrong-in-big-ways-but-can-it-change-a-chat-with-robert-whi/</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In the article I subsequently wrote, cited by Lacasse &amp; Leo (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823368), my use of that phrase was in direct reference to Whitaker’s interview and to his own choice of words. I made this clear as far back as April, 2014, in a comment I posted beneath my Medscape article (available online). Careful scholars would surely have observed this and not falsely attributed Whitaker\'s phrase to me. The Medscape article has since been corrected.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.  Citing information properly disclosed by me over a decade ago, Lacasse &amp; Leo allege that I was “paid to help [pharmaceutical companies] promote their products...” This is categorically false. The allegation by Lacasse &amp; Leo was not based on any direct knowledge of my professional or contractual arrangements dating back to 2003. Never, at any time, have I accepted any monies from pharmaceutical companies (or anyone else) with the intent or purpose of promoting their products. Nor have I ever had any ongoing financial relationships with any pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A detailed rejoinder to Lacasse &amp; Leo will appear in the winter issue of \"The Behavior Therapist,\" where the Lacasse &amp; Leo article originally appeared. However, I respectfully request that you run a correction on your website as soon as possible; e.g., by posting this communication. I consider this a matter that impinges on my professional reputation, and I reserve all rights in pursuit of a just resolution.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Sincerely,
Ronald Pies MD
Professor of Psychiatry</p>
