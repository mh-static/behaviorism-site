Unhinged, by Daniel Carlat, MD

Dr. Carlat is a psychiatrist who has written something of an exposé of the abuses that reside within the psychiatric profession.  Many of his chapters echo topics that have been addressed frequently on this blog.  Dr. Carlat still clings to the notion that problem behaviors can be accurately conceptualized as illnesses, but he does criticize the proliferation of “diagnoses” and the application of these “diagnoses” to increasing numbers of individuals.

He also provides first-hand information on the methods that drug companies use to persuade physicians to prescribe their products.  It’s a sordid business – one which he himself eventually found too distasteful.

So – an interesting book on a critically important topic.  Well worth reading.
