There's an interesting new article by Paula Caplan <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-isnt-golden/201303/comedy-history-and-the-future-mental-disorder-labels">here</a>.  It discusses the harmful effects of psychiatric "diagnoses," including the fact that because of these labels, people have lost their "… jobs, custody of children, health insurance, and the right to make decisions about their medical and legal affairs."

Paula also mentions a petition she created in December 2011 calling for "<strong>Congressional Hearings about Psychiatric Diagnosis</strong>."  The petition is still up. You can find it<a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/everyone-who-cares-about-the-harm-done-by-psychiatric-diagnosis-endorse-the-call-for-congressional-hearings-about-psychiatric-diagnosis"> here</a>

I have signed, and am encouraging others to do so if they wish.
