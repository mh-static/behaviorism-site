On June 1, 2012, I wrote a post titled <i><a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2012/06/01/there-are-no-mental-illnesses/">There Are No Mental Illnesses</a>.</i>

Yesterday a comment came in on this post.Â  Here's a quote:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When my brother was thirty years old, he started to see objects, which was far away, like hawk. His "mind" wanted to understand it, so he started to think he became a cybrog. Doctor said: you are ill". When I saw strange things, I said to myself: "Well, I see strange things" that's all. And I'm healthy..."</p>
It seems to me that these few lines sum up so succinctly the arbitrary and spurious nature of psychiatric "diagnosis."
