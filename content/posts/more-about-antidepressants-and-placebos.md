The debate is over.  Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.  And yet the “depression-is-an-illness” lobby continues to grasp for straws.

Fiona Godlee, editor of the British Medical Journal, recently cited “evidence” of the efficacy of antidepressants.  For a <a href="http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/everybody-has-won-and-all-must-have.html">critique</a> of the Godlee article go to Duncan Double’s website “<a href="http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/">Critical Psychiatry</a>.”

Surprise finding! - Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.

What this means in effect is that people are “curing” their own depression (gasp), and perhaps don’t really need the mental health practitioners (double gasp).
