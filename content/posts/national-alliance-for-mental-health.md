This is a new group:  "…a grassroots organization dedicated to providing accurate information and resources to families and individuals seeking better mental health."  I discovered them thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/TallaTrialogue">Tallaght Trialogue</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zebraspolkadots">zebdot</a> on Twitter.

They're <i>not</i> affiliated with the National Alliance on Mental Illness (despite the similarity in title), and their philosophy is very different from NAMI's.

You can read about them <a href="http://www.nationalallianceformentalhealth.com/about/">here</a>, and their posts, by Dennis Dodson, are <a href="http://www.nationalallianceformentalhealth.com/">here.</a>

Here are some quotes from Dennis's <a href="http://www.nationalallianceformentalhealth.com/let-me-introduce-myself/">first post</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I’m 60 years old and have experienced great emotional turmoil for the majority of my adult life. I was in the typical mental health treatment system for over 30 years and never became stable or really had any peace or true happiness even though I followed the medication model and was faithful to “take my medicine”."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I was diagnosed as bipolar I and the treatment I received for those 30 odd years was refill after refill after refill."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I began to examine my past experiences and I took personal responsibility for my mental health and the poor choices I had made for most of my adult life."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I learned that my brain rewarded me with each better choice I made. I came to realize that there were solutions readily available for my issues."</p>
There's lots of good stuff, with suggestions for people who are trying to get their lives on a good track.  Well worth watching.
