There's a must-read article on Leonie's Blog: <i><a href="http://leoniefennell.wordpress.com/2013/06/29/the-grieving-mother-is-at-it-again/">The grieving mother is at it again!</a></i>

Leonie lost a son to suicide four years ago.  The suicide occurred 17 days after he started citalopram, an SSRI, marketed as Celexa.

Leonie heard a 'science expert' on the radio this week attributing depression to low serotonin levels in the brain.

Leonie asks:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"How can these idiots keep spouting the ‘chemical imbalance’ rubbish? It is drug company propaganda at its best and has no scientific basis, no factually based evidence whatsoever to conclude that depression is anything other than a reaction to life itself."</p>
The post is brief but compelling, and gives us one more reason to keep saying:  <strong>depression is not an illness, and drugs are not medicines</strong>.

Please read and pass on.
