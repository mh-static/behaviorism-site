A mass murder occurred yesterday, September 16, at the U.S. Navy Yard in Washington D.C.  There are reports of at least 12 dead, and several wounded.  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/contract-worker-behind-navy-yard-shooting-rampage-111847531.html">Early news stories</a> describe the perpetrator as having "mental issues," and it is reported that he "…had been <strong>treated since August by the Veterans Administration for his mental problems</strong>."  It is likely that this "treatment" involved the prescription of psychiatric drugs.

And still no government inquiry into the <strong>link between psycho-pharmaceutical products, especially SSRI's, and acts of violence/suicide.</strong>

Why does the government not take this simple step to uncover the facts?  Could it be because the pharmaceutical industry is one of the top contributors nationwide to politicians' re-election campaigns?

According to <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=H4300">OpenSecrets.org</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Pharmaceutical companies, which develop both over-the-counter and prescription drugs, have been among the biggest political spenders for years."</p>
In an article titled <i><a href="http://www.ringoffireradio.com/2012/09/big-pharmas-influence-machine-2/">Big Pharma's Influence Machine</a>,</i> Farron Cousins, of Ring of Fire Radio states:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"But when it comes to affecting policy in Washington, D.C., no organization or industry has gamed the system better than the pharmaceutical industry."</p>
[Ring of Fire Radio is a nationally syndicated talk show program.  The presenters, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire_(radio_program)">Wikipedia</a>, see their goal as "exposing people whom they consider to be 'corporate fat cats, polluters and media spinmeisters.'"]

What's needed is an <i>impartial</i> government inquiry.  Who could argue with that?
