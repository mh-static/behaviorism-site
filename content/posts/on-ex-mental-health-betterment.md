As Ex mental health patient culture to me wasn't very helpful, I was expecting more of a professional environment, ready to help you start your career, open up flexible opportunities to make money by business networking, etc, and become a happy, successful individual and not a slave to the sadistic culture known as psychiatry.

However, it only lead to older people resorting to preferred victimhood, nagging old hags who's phony, fake, and disingenuous ways just were unhelpful, and the simple mindset of all hat and no cattle when it comes to a "better life for the mentally ill" just seems to never come into fruition.

I've come to realize the ex mental health culture is all hat no cattle. Scapegoating and playing the effeminate role of "The victim being held by the metaphorical chain of the psychiatric massa" seems to be favorable by subconscious decisions made by ex mental health patients. The group think that ex mental health patients like to believe the culture of the sane will always treat us like crap, so we should always see an apocalyptic outlook of our destiny as ex mental health patients, forever the victims of a "Sane dominated society".

You can try to question or be a skeptic to the claims that ex mental health patient culture, and alternative medicinal culture, tend to make, and you will be bombarded with ad hominem attacks or be told "How dare you question that theory, are you sure your not a spy for big pharma?"

It's going to be hard for the ex mental health patient community to stop playing the victim and scapegoat psychiatry, hoping militaristic violence will solve our problems within the psychiatric and sane culture, when it will only enforce the wounds we still will be nursing, being left in the state of confusion about our own sufferings, and even worse, will be searching for another victim we can exploit for our cause of the smug "I told you he/she understood what actual suffering is" or a scapegoat we can taunt and harass until they submit into our actually abusive tactics on how they forever will live a life full of misery until departure from hell.

We as ex mental health patients need to start opening up to start our own businesses, plan our own fundings from private organizations we agree with on most things, develop good relationships with vendors, merchants, etc. So we can become financially independent individuals.  Instead rely on the constant victimization, endless hopefulness of the "psychiatrist to change", when he/she never will, because they are narcissists, and you cannot change their way of thinking, and revengeful venting on relying on coercive militaristic force to abolish psychiatry altogether.

The only thing that holds us back is the mindset of the "people pleaser syndrome" most ex mental health patients have subconsciously.  Nobody wants to be incarcerated when you did not commit the crime in the first place, be subjected to cruel or unusual punishment, or be permanent damaged by drugs or therapies. But when you live your life in deep embedded fear, worrying an event like Selma will happen if the ex mental health patients protest against psychiatry again, or any form of brutal public humiliation, I'm sorry, your actually failing yourself and others you blindly state "you care about" when in reality, you really don't, just stating that to make yourself look like a wonderful person.

Instead of playing the victim and hoping a narcissist will change, let's focus on building a culture of self employed business success stories instead of hopeless deadbeats being subjugated by sadistic psychiatric fetishes the demon doctors will keep attempting if we as a culture don't develop a set of iron balls in the meantime.

I am an ex mental health patient, and I'm appalled by the half ass attempts ex mental health patient's put into when it comes into outside opportunities when it comes to our financial and social independence. It seems acting like we care will abolish our painful memories of abuse, and comfortably play the victim until we get locked up as usual.

How much do y'all give a F*** about progressing the ex mental health culture and developing into a more privatized financial and social culture? Please give me an explanation on this.

Thank you.
