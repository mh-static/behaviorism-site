David Healy, MD, is a controversial figure.  On the one hand, he is a fierce and determined opponent of the escalating use of antidepressant drugs.  On the other hand, he is one of the world's leading proponents of electric shock "treatment."

For the latter reason, I'm somewhat hesitant to quote his work, but he writes good anti-antidepressant articles, and his points are usually well-researched and compelling.

I've recently come across an article called <i><a href="http://davidhealy.org/prozac-and-ssris-twenty-fifth-anniversary/">Prozac and SSRIs: Twenty-fifth Anniversary</a>,</i> which Dr. Healy wrote in February of this year.  Here are some quotes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"…there is an increase of 5% to 10% in the number of people hooked to antidepressants each year."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There are probably something between 1000-1500 extra suicides in the US each year, triggered by an antidepressant – an extra 2000 -2500 in Europe."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There are probably between 1000- 1500 extra episodes of violence in the US each year that would not have happened without antidepressant input and between 2000-2500 extra episodes in Europe."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Most children born to mothers who have been on these drugs do not have obvious birth defects. But it increasingly looks as though these children may show cognitive delay and other autistic spectrum features."</p>
It's well worth a look.
