Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/tommymorrela">Tommy Morrela</a> on Twitter, I've become aware of <a href="http://wellbeingfoundation.com/">The Wellbeing Foundation</a>.  They are located in Ireland.  Here are some quotes from their <a href="http://wellbeingfoundation.com/aboutus.html">About Us</a> page.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"To call human suffering a disease, something pathological, is deluded. The biological model of psychological distress has no basis in science; it takes away from the equation between 'healer', sufferer and society the need for understanding, compassion, healing, prevention and social and political change. The medicalisation of problems of living has to stop. We have a collective duty of care to bring about the destruction of psychiatry in its present form."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Countless millions worldwide have been broken in mind and spirit by psychiatric practices; turned into zombies by years of hospitalisation, by lobotomies, by repeated shock 'treatments' and by years of medication. They have lived out their lives as institutionalised slaves, their inner light extinguished."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Instead of the biological-medical model of psychological distress, with its emphasis on brain chemistry as the 'cause' of 'illness', the Wellbeing Foundation approach is holistic, existential and humanitarian."</p>
Nothing ambiguous there!

Psychiatry is not something that's basically OK, but needs some minor corrections.  Psychiatry is something <i>fundamentally flawed</i> that needs to be <i>condemned and ostracized</i> relentlessly<i>.</i>  We need to distance ourselves from this destructive practice and provide <strong>genuine help to people who are experiencing difficulties.</strong>

Psychiatry has been on its present spurious and destructive track for at least six decades and, with each passing year, reaffirms its total commitment to the disempowering and stigmatizing medical model.

The Wellbeing Foundation has been promoting an alternative viewpoint since 2006.  Please take a look at their website, and pass the word.
