It is no secret that pharma-psychiatry has come under considerable criticism in recent years.  In general, they do not respond to these criticisms, but instead they continue to beat the same old drum:  mental illness is becoming increasingly prevalent; we need more mental health screenings; we need more funding for "treatment"; and we need wider coercive powers to ensure that these sick people take their drugs.  They are also using the school shootings to generate alarm about "untreated" mental illness, and are calling in support from various quarters, including politicians.

On December 12, U.S. Representative Tim Murphy presented a bill in the House that will, if passed, promote more coercive tactics in the mental health field.  It would also weaken clients' rights, including their rights to privacy and confidentiality.

The National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery (NCMHR) is a psychiatric survivors' advocacy organization.  They have today issued an <a href="http://ymlp.com/zDOfoN">action alert</a> asking those of us on this side of the debate to oppose the bill, and to spread the word.  In particular, they ask that we phone our political representatives either today (Monday) or tomorrow (Tuesday) and encourage them <em>not to co-sponsor or support the bill</em>.

If you live in the US, please help block this regressive measure.  Please take a look at NCMHR's notice, and phone your representative.  It's important that we take this step quickly to prevent the bill garnering additional co-sponsors.  We can write detailed letters later.  The NCMHR's notice provides information on how to contact your representative, etc...

Please help spread the word.  In politics, numbers count!
