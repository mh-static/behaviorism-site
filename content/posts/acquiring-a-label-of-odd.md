<span style="color: #222222;"><a href="/images/tell-your-story.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1519" src="/images/tell-your-story.png" alt="This post was submitted by a reader." width="247" height="209" /></a>Oppositional Defiant Disorder has to be the cruellest label, </span><span style="color: #222222;">stigmatization of all. Allegedly caused by "inconsistent Parenting" </span><span style="color: #222222;">routinely misinterpreted to mean "different parenting styles" children </span><span style="color: #222222;">who are bored in school, whose coping mechanisms, eg. zoning out, </span><span style="color: #222222;">messing in class, who are unable and or unwilling to learn </span><span style="color: #222222;">unchallenging material, who question, who are more advanced than their </span><span style="color: #222222;">peer age group are routinely labelled as O.D.D. </span>

<span style="color: #222222;">My 12 year old son was </span><span style="color: #222222;">"diagnosed" by a psychologist engaged by the Primary School, with my </span><span style="color: #222222;">consent (he was advanced, accelerated development and bored in school) </span><span style="color: #222222;">so I agreed to an educational assessment. Such assessment was carried </span><span style="color: #222222;">out one day over a couple of hours or so. I had a chat with </span><span style="color: #222222;">Psychologist as did the Class Teacher and the School Principal (an </span><span style="color: #222222;">unscrupulous man with a grudge against the family). Both I and the </span><span style="color: #222222;">school filled in Checklists (I understood that the Class Teacher would </span><span style="color: #222222;">be filling in the Checklist - but it appears that it may have been the </span><span style="color: #222222;">Principal )- Psychologist wont discuss anything with me saying that </span><span style="color: #222222;">she was only paid by the school to carry out an assessment. Request </span><span style="color: #222222;">for documents under Data Protection Legislation proved fruitless as I </span><span style="color: #222222;">am not the Data Subject - my son is and he knows nothing about the </span><span style="color: #222222;">diagnosis, which was used by the unscrupulous Principal to stigmatise </span><span style="color: #222222;">and ostracise him (told parents, as "duty of care" to discourage their </span><span style="color: #222222;">children from associating with him. </span>

<span style="color: #222222;">The Psychologist's report included </span><span style="color: #222222;">statements from the Class Teacher to the effect that my son often sits </span><span style="color: #222222;">in class doing nothing and that he sometimes gets side tracked into </span><span style="color: #222222;">messing. This Class Teacher that same year gave a school report </span><span style="color: #222222;">stating that my son was "outgoing, down to earth, very helpful to </span><span style="color: #222222;">teacher and was not learning to his full ability". The Psychologists </span><span style="color: #222222;">findings were that my son had "exceptional intelligence, exceptional </span><span style="color: #222222;">academic ability and was seriously underachieving". She included a </span><span style="color: #222222;">Rating Scales Table in her Report, which listed about 6 or 7 groups of </span><span style="color: #222222;">unrelated behaviours with a cumulative score - three groups got in the </span><span style="color: #222222;">high to very high range resulting in a diagnosis of "severe emotional </span><span style="color: #222222;">and behavioural problems", "severe O.D.D." Two versions of the Report </span><span style="color: #222222;">were issued - one for the parents - this didn't include the word </span><span style="color: #222222;">"severe" and the other which did was issued to three third parties </span><span style="color: #222222;">including the School. </span>

<span style="color: #222222;">My son was prescribed Resource Hours which at </span><span style="color: #222222;">the time I was given to believe were for educational purposes as the </span><span style="color: #222222;">feed back to me was solely on educational matters, stating that my son </span><span style="color: #222222;">had exceptional intelligence but that some of his scores were very low </span><span style="color: #222222;">- possibly due to reluctance to engage - but the Psychologist was </span><span style="color: #222222;">concerned particularly in light of low spatial results (checks three </span><span style="color: #222222;">years later by an actual specialist educational Psychologist for </span><span style="color: #222222;">educational blocks - revealed none). </span>

<span style="color: #222222;">My son had no reported behaviour </span><span style="color: #222222;">issues in school which would suggest ODD and a Connors Questionnaire </span><span style="color: #222222;">filled in by the School (age 8 - 9, the appropriate age for assessment </span><span style="color: #222222;">revealed very good behaviour). The examining Psychologist based her </span><span style="color: #222222;">diagnoses on the Checklists from which a graph was drawn; the graph </span><span style="color: #222222;">highlighted conditions listed in the high rating scores; these </span><span style="color: #222222;">conditions then transferred onto a Checklist. The Checklist as the </span><span style="color: #222222;">name implies leads to a list of conditions highlighted in the Rating </span><span style="color: #222222;">Scales which require checking. So a high score in zoning out in class </span><span style="color: #222222;">will tick conditions such as "thought disorder" "inability to focus". </span><span style="color: #222222;">"concentration problems" "day dreaming" "anxiety" in the same way as </span><span style="color: #222222;">frequent severe headaches will highlight conditions such as "Brain </span><span style="color: #222222;">Tumour", "Migrane", "Clot"," Brain Aneurysm" This doesn't mean the </span><span style="color: #222222;">patient has all these conditions (might only be stressed) - rather </span><span style="color: #222222;">that the patient needs to be checked under these categories. </span>

<span style="color: #222222;">My son </span><span style="color: #222222;"> was assigned all the categories highlighted in Rating Scales as though </span><span style="color: #222222;">he had them and convicted with a heinous crime / disorder and given a </span><span style="color: #222222;">life sentence / death sentence if he ever finds out.</span>
