I've recently come across an October 2012 article by Ted Chabasinski.  It's on Mad in America and it's called:  <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/10/our-task-is-to-take-away-the-power-of-psychiatry/"><i>Our Task Is to Take Away the Power of Psychiatry</i>.</a>

Ted tells us that <strong>he was was subjected to electric shock "treatment" when he was six years old</strong>.  You can see a <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/author/tchabasinski/">brief bio here</a>.

Here are some quotes from the October 2012 article:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Those who benefit from the way things are now won’t give up their money and power without a huge fight."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I should note here that the campaigns against so-called 'stigma' by groups like NAMI, when studied, showed that they actually made public attitudes toward us even worse."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"At bottom, psychiatric power is based on what is essentially a religious faith in psychiatry. People believe in the 'miracles' of psychiatry in spite of the complete lack of factual basis for these beliefs."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"We have been attacked and damaged by one of the most evil institutions in this society."</p>
Ted writes with honesty and conviction.  Please take a look, and pass it along.
