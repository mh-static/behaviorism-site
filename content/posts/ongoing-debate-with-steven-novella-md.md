A few days ago I came across some text on Dr. Novella's website that appeared to be his response to my recent critique.  I drafted a response to this and posted it at 5:40 this morning.  Dr. Novella has commented on this and has informed me that the material in question was <em>not</em> written by him.  Apparently it was written by one of his commenters, who is also named Steve.

I have removed the post in question, and I offer my profound apologies to Dr. Novella and to any of my readers who read the post and were consequently misled.
