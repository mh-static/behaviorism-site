On September 25, PsychCentral ran an <a href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/09/25/do-antidepressants-increase-risk-of-diabetes/59914.html">article</a> on this topic.Â  The article was a commentary on a <a href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/36/10/3337">2013 meta-analysis</a> conducted by Katharine Barnard, PhD, et al of the University of Southamptom, UK.

The meta-analysis examined three systemic reviews and 22 studies.

RESULTS
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There was evidence that antidepressant use is associated with type 2 diabetes. Causality is not established, but rather, the picture is confused, with some antidepressants linked to worsening glucose control, particularly with higher doses and longer duration, others linked with improved control, and yet more with mixed results. The more recent, larger studies, however, suggest a modest effect."</p>
CONCLUSIONS
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Although evidence exists that antidepressant use may be an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, long-term prospective studies of the effects of individual antidepressants rather than class effects are required. Heightened alertness to potential risks is necessary until these are complete."</p>
One more reason to be concerned about antidepressants!
