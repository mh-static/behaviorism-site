Today I received the following email from Emily Underwood, a reporter with Science Magazine.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am a reporter with Science magazine -- after reading your Twitter feed and blog I thought you might be interested in a live video chat I’m hosting this week on the controversy surrounding the DSM V. My guests are Allen Frances of Duke University, William Eaton of Johns Hopkins University, and Frank Farley of Temple University; given their different takes on the subject it promises to be a lively conversation!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We’re hoping to have as many audience members as possible tuning in and asking great questions of our guests - would you be willing to promote the chat on your blog or Twitter feed? The chat will run from 3-4pm EST on Thursday, May 23rd, at this website:</p>

Allen Frances (psychiatrist) was the head of DSM-IV, but has been a vocal critic of DSM-5, whilst insisting that DSM-IV was OK.

William Eaton (psychologist) argues for the retention of what he calls "mild cases" in the DSM on the grounds that "...treatment of mild cases might prevent a substantial proportion of future serious cases."

Frank Farley (psychologist) has critiqued DSM-5 on the grounds of reliability, and has expressed the view that "…we need to go back to the drawing board."
