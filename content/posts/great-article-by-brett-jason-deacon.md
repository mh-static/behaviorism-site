In the current issue of Clinical Psychology Review (April 8, 2013), you will find a very interesting article by Brett Jason Deacon, PhD, who is an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Wyoming.  The article is called <i>The Biomedical Model of Mental Disorder: A Critical Analysis of its Tenets, Consequences, and Effects on Psychotherapy Research</i>.  You can see it <a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Deacon-biomedical-model-and-stigma-2013.pdf">here</a>.

The article is a critique of the biomedical model from a theoretical and a practical perspective.  The author has managed to elucidate a comprehensive range of criticisms of the biomedical model, and has blended them together into a coherent and compelling account.

Dr. Deacon also discusses psychosocial alternatives to the bio-psychiatric approach.

Here are some quotes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Evidence-based psychosocial theories and treatments have faded into the background as biological theories of mental disorder and newer-generation psychotropic medications have risen to preeminent status."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The biomedical model’s eliminative reductionist philosophy that biology is inherently fundamental to psychology rests on shaky scientific ground."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Given the historical lack of scientific evidence for the chemical imbalance theory of mental disorder, why have biomedical advocates promoted this story?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If psychotropic medications are safe and effective, why has the rate of mental health disability risen in close temporal association with their increasing use?"</p>
It's one of those articles that you will probably want to keep close and refer to often.
