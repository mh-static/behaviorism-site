There's an article in the current issue of Clinical Toxicology, titled <a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15563650.2013.829233"><i>Drug-induced seizures in children and adolescents presenting for emergency care: Current and emerging trends</i></a>, authored by Y. Finkelstein et al.

The authors conducted an observational study, on 37 sites, of all pediatric Emergency Room reports which included a chemical or drug-induced seizure and required a toxicology consultation between April 2010 and March 2012.

RESULTS
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Antidepressants were the most commonly identified agents ingestedâ€¦"(42%).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"All antidepressant-induced seizures in teenagers were intentional and represented self-harm behavior."</p>
DISCUSSION

This study lends support to the notion that I have mentioned before: that <strong>psycho-pharmaceutical products may have more in common with street drugs</strong> than with medications proper.
