If you haven't seen <a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/">Jon Rappoport's blog</a>, please take a look.  Here are two quotes from his September 22 post, <i><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/09/22/psychiatry-targets-college-students-for-destruction/">Psychiatry targets college students for destruction</a>:</i>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The concept called 'mental disorder' is a sales pitch backed up by extraordinary PR, money, academic gibberish, and government-granted official status."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"People need to wake up to the fact that the whole panoply of human suffering has been co-opted, taken over, redefined, re-translated into a lexicon of pseudoscience."</p>
And another quote from his September 28 post, <i><a href="http://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2013/09/28/alexis-lanza-holmes-and-the-psychiatric-state/">Alexis, Lanza, Holmes and the Psychiatric State</a>:</i>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Close to 50 years ago, psychiatry was dying out as a profession. Fewer and fewer people wanted to see a psychiatrist for help, for talk therapy. All sorts of new therapies were popping up. The competition was leaving medical psychiatry in the dust.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As Dr. Peter Breggin describes it in his landmark book, Toxic Psychiatry, a deal was struck. Drug companies would bankroll psychiatry and rescue it. These companies would pour money into professional conferences, journals, research. In return, they wanted 'science' that would promote mental disease as a biological fact, a gateway into the drugs. Everyone would win—except the patient.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So the studies were rolled out, and the list of mental disorders expanded. The FDA was in on the deal as well, as evidenced by their drug 'safety' approvals, in the face of the obvious damage these drugs were doing.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So this is how we arrived at where we are. This was the plan, and it worked.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Under the cover story, it was all fraud all the time. Without much of a stretch, you could say psychiatry has been the most widespread profiling operation in the history of the human race. Its goal has been to bring humans everywhere into its system. It hardly matters which label a person is painted with, as long as it adds up to a diagnosis and a prescription of drugs."</p>
Jon addresses the <strong>spurious and destructive nature of psychiatry</strong> in no-nonsense, hard-hitting language.  His material is relevant and current, and very much worth reading.
