A few weeks ago I recommended <em>Taking America Off Drugs</em> by Stephen Ray Flora.  Well, he has also written <em>The Power of Reinforcement</em> (State University of New York Press, 2004), and this also is well worth reading.

Reinforcement is a crucial concept in psychology, and in this book Dr. Flora clarifies the matter and dispels the misinformation.

Buy it; read it; keep it close.
