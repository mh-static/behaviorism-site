This is an anti-psychiatry website.  I say this with no apology.  I am opposed to psychiatry because:
<ul>
	<li>Its concepts are pathetically spurious, and have no explanatory value.</li>
	<li>Its practices are harmful, disempowering and stigmatizing.</li>
	<li>It is routinely deceptive towards it clients and towards the general public.</li>
	<li>It has avidly sustained a corrupt and corrupting relationship with pharma.</li>
</ul>
But every once in a while I come across a psychiatrist who is different.  Recently I came across a post written by 1 Boring Old Man.  The post - titled <i><a href="http://1boringoldman.com/index.php/2012/02/20/no-further-comment/">no further comment</a> -</i> is dated February 20 2012.

Here are two quotes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I think it’s time for the body of Psychiatry to look back on the last thirty years, particularly the last twenty, and acknowledge that there has been a lot of just outright wrong: producing and accepting lousy science; signing on to lousy science produced by others; colluding with the Pharmaceutical Industry in recommendations and prescriptions; corruption involving ghost-writing, guest authoring, conflicts of interest, direct drug promotion, downplaying or ignoring adverse effects."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I was a <i>Silent Witness</i> to something pretty rotten, and I didn’t take the time or put in the effort to scope it out. So I share in the shame. Like a lot of us, I quit the APA instead of going to the meetings and offering an opposing and questioning voice. I am truly sorry about that. No further comment to follow…</p>
<strong>Writing something like that takes a lot of courage.</strong>
