Two days ago, on July 9, Richard Lewis published on Mad in America a post in which he draws attention to the prolific worldwide prescribing of benzodiazepines, and the problems that this creates.  The article includes a music video of a song which Richard has written and performs.  The song is called Benzo Blue, and it "highlights the struggles of the millions of worldwide victims/survivors of prescribed benzodiazepine drugs such as Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and Valium."

Benzo Blue is a powerful and moving indictment of psychiatry’s widely promoted agenda that virtually every human problem is an illness, and that for each of these  so-called illnesses there is a "safe and effective" pill.

Benzodiazepines are a class of anxiolytic (i.e. anxiety-relieving) drugs.  But, like most psychiatric drugs, the short-term relief is usually eclipsed by severe long-term harm.  Benzodiazepines are marketed under the brand names Valium, Librium, Xanax, Ativan, Tranxene, Klonopin, Dalmane, etc.

Today is World Benzodiazepine Awareness Day (<a href="http://w-bad.org/">WBAD</a>).  The About tab on the WBAD website states:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"World Benzodiazepine Awareness Day seeks to raise global awareness about the severe problem of medical-induced benzodiazepine drug dependency that continues to affect millions of unsuspecting, innocent people worldwide—either directly or indirectly."</p>
Richard Lewis is a committed and forthright critic of psychiatry.  He writes regularly on MIA.  You can view his video below.  Please take a look and pass it on.
