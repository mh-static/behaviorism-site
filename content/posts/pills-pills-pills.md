I've mentioned Alice Keys before on this blog.  She's a psychiatrist who laments the fact that psychiatry has become virtually synonymous with drug pushing, and has expressed her concerns from time to time on Robert Whitaker's Mad in America website.

Alice has a new post up today, called <em>Winners of the American Dream</em>.  You can see it <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/04/winners-of-the-american-dream/">here</a>.  She has decided to quit psychiatry.  "Pills are the only thing left in psychiatry.  So I stopped working."

The post describes a conversation that Alice had recently with a young mother at the beach.  The article is short and very readable, and provides a <strong>truly insightful snapshot of how parents can get sucked into the pill trap</strong>.
