There's a <a href="http://involuntarytransformation.blogspot.com/2011/04/fishing-lessons-from-my-son.html#.UWBNjZOG0eU">nice article at Involuntary Transformation</a> on this topic.

The author, Nathan, poses a very interesting question:  since drugs cause damage to children and there are many better alternatives, <strong>why do so many parents choose the drug option</strong>?

Nathan goes on to suggest that the reason lies in the effort that the pharmaceutical industry invests in marketing, and he calls for "…complete and total transparency in all Mental Health Services."

I couldn't agree more.
