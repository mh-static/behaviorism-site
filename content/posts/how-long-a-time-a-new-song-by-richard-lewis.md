Psychiatry is a hoax.  The "mental illnesses" that it invents with increasing frequency are not illnesses in any ordinary sense of the term.  Its "diagnoses" are destructive, disempowering, and stigmatizing; and its "treatments" (drugs and electric shocks) always do more damage than good, especially in the long term.

In our struggle against this destructive travesty, it's important to deliver our message in a variety of methods, including music.  In July 2017, Richard Lewis published the <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2017/07/benzo-blue-song-protest-search-liberation/">music video "Benzo Blue"</a> on Mad in America.  The song "highlights the struggles of the millions of worldwide victims/survivors of prescribed benzodiazepine drugs such as Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, and Valium."

Last week Richard published a new video called "How Long a Time".  You can see it on Mad in America <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/04/how-long-a-time-ten-cold-hard-truths-for-ending-psychiatric-abuse/">here</a>.  It's a powerful piece of work, which captures the plight and frustrations of people caught in the drug-pushing net of psychiatric "care".  Here are the lyrics, which I've transcribed from the video.
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">"How Long A Time"
Written and Performed by Richard Lewis</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">Dedicated to all the victims and families harmed by psychiatry and the oppressive "Mental Health" system</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">Tell me how long a time
Will it take to be free
From all of their chains
They have wrapped around me
Oh, there's more on my mind
I still have to lose
They'll darken your soul
And lay bare the blues</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">Tell me how long a time
Must we all endure
All them made-up diseases
Oh they promise to cure
All their labels and drugs
That will lock up your mind
Darken your soul
And no peace will you find</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">No peace will you find
At Doctor Feel Good's pharmacy
Damn all their lies
God damn psychiatry
Got more chains on my mind
Oh I still have to lose
They'll darken your soul
Oh, and lay bare the blues.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">Oh can't trust them to know all my fears
Or about the time
Oh I wanted to die
Won't let them ever lock me away
Or even see me cry</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">No, no, no tell me how long a time
Before people will see
Oh we're not broken brains
Or defective genes
Oh it's a troubled world
Oh, full of anxiety
Oh, we all have our stories
And we all have our dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">Remember your stories
Oh, and hold on to your dreams
'Cause no peace will you find
Oh at Doctor Feel Good's pharmacy
Damn all their lies
God damn psychiatry
Got more chains on my mind
Oh I still have to lose
They'll darken your soul
Oh, and lay bare the blues.
They'll darken your soul
Oh, and lay bare the blues.</p>
