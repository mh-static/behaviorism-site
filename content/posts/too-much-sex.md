Christopher Lane recently published an interesting<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201204/american-sex-and-american-psychiatry"> article </a>on Psychology Today.

The article covers a number of topics, including the APA’s proposal to include “hypersexual disorder” in the upcoming DSM-5.  The implications of this proposed “diagnosis” are that if you think about sex too much or engage in sexual activity too much, then you have a mental illness.

Back in the 60’s, when I was at college, I would frequently find myself chatting with a group of fellow students on a wide range of topics, including sex.  Often someone would cite the old statistic that the average young adult male thinks about sex 171 times a day (or whatever), to which the chorus of replies was always – “no way; it’s much more often than that.”

The point being – who’s to say that a person is engaging in too much sexual activity?  Only the APA, with its self-serving agenda of medicalizing more and more aspects of normal human existence coupled with its monumental arrogance, would take such a step.
