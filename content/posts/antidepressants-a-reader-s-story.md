Good afternoon

I live in São Paulo, Brazil, I'm 35 years old, single, and always said I had depression. Was considered slow, sad, spoke little, called donkey and cold, and all this time I thought it was true and should see a psychiatrist.

I searched, the psychiatrist asked a few questions, and used antidepressants, Pristiq and others. At first I was very excited, since it was a more cheerful and talkative person, but two months later went and had the effect of increasing the dose and use lamictal,the remedy worked a little, changed my personality and was a person different, but felt did not want this all my life.

Decided I should face life as I really am, and not worry with what people pensam.Sou introverted, speak little, but discovered that there speak little because I'm sick, but because they do not like to talk much. Do not consider myself very smart, but what is enough and I'm learning lot and made someone feel glad.

I think the big problem with depression is that the person must accept who she really is, is self-knowledge, and it changes lives for the better.

Today not take antidepressants, improved my diet, stopped thinking I'm mentally ill, and now I am a happy person, I do what I do and what not I do not blame myself, each person has their potential is limited.

I believe that a good life philosophy or a religion can help a person to have values ​​and friends to be together, do not mean the mystic aspect of <span style="color: #222222;">relgiião</span>, but the community aspect, trying to be a better person every day and do well, have a good diet, and not expect too much of people, this is a good way.

I knew your site, I really like your comments Dr.Phill, and I believe Change is in the behavior, people must believe that they can changing. It is sad that behavioral psychology is not as valued.  In Brazil, people do much protest, demonstration, has been violent, people want rights, duties, rights, duties but do not want to, find the government has to do everything for them, and use violence.

I read your article, I can not remember the name but it was about the lack of respect life, property and feelings of others, this is the problem of society. People need to be educated to change their behavior and be responsible.

Thank you
