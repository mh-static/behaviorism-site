She was shy and fearful too, about life but not growing up in the cocoon of a large family, the youngest of 6 children. I was the oldest girl and required to work at the family business every summer starting at 9 years old. Sis, I will call her di not have to do anything. 6 years younger than me she was bought expensive clothes because my parents had more money. I was bought cheap things and when I hit 16 was told that I had to buy all my clothes from then on. I left and now am so glad I did.

Sis was told she was a musical genius by my mother from an earlier age. Sis developed a lot of contempt for her peers because she did nothing but practice and di in fact become very accomplished. once out of school she was hired by an orchestra. Sis was first chair and did not want to give it up. From the day someone else was given her seat she went mad. She made up a story about them doing horrible things to her like attempted rape. They believed her. A big mistake. Sis moved in with me and my future husband for 6 months during which time she walked around in her underwear a lot. I finally told her to leave. I was blamed. She was brought up to think she could do no wrong.

Once she was in the system with a free apartment and all the trimmings, freed drugs 'meds' and all day and night partying she got really messed up. Sis developed liver problems, then cancer and died.

We all tried, I had a lot of burden too, but now that I look back I think we just enabled a scared, spoiled girl to carry on in a any way she wanted. There were so many times I thought it was an act of some kind but of course everyone would get so angry at me that it was terrible. I was cut out of my mother's will too.  All they thought about was Sis and what a sad lovely genius he was. Sometimes I think it was my mom that was crazy.

Yes I think it is the shyness, reticence and fear of responsibility that propels this condition (I would never say illness to her or anyone). She could be entirely sane acting when she was inclined to (or when she slipped up?).

That's my story. it was sure weird.
