There's an article titled <a href="http://sectioneduk.wordpress.com/2013/06/19/restraint/"><i>Restraint â€“ 10 ways it harms psychiatric patients</i></a> on Sectioned's blog today.

It describes Sectioned's own experience in this area.

Sectioned lists ten ways he/she was harmed by this practice, and the article is well worth reading.
