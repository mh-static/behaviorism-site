<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Last month (December 2013) the American Journal of Psychiatry published </span><a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=1795083&amp;resultClick=1"><i style="line-height: 1.5em;">Antidepressant-Induced Liver Injury: A Review for Clinicians</i></a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, by Voican C.S. et al.Â  The study was a literature search from 1965 onwards.</span>

Here are the authors' results:
<ul>
	<li>All antidepressants can induce hepatotoxicity, especially in elderly patients and those taking more than one drug</li>
	<li>Liver damage is generally unpredictable and unrelated to dose</li>
	<li>Liver damage can occur within a few days of initiation</li>
	<li>Antidepressant-induced liver failure can be life threatening</li>
	<li>Antidepressants with <i>higher</i> risk for liver failure include: iproniazid, nefazodone, phenelzine, imipramine, amitriptyline, duloxetine, bupropion, trazodone, tianeptine, and agomelatine</li>
	<li>Antidepressants with <i>lower</i> risk: citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine</li>
	<li>Although an infrequent event, antidepressant-induced liver injury may be irreversible</li>
</ul>
