On November 28, I put up a <a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/11/28/benzodiazepines-adverse-effects/">post</a> on the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, including the potential for protracted and serious withdrawal problems.

Since then I've become aware of a helpful and interesting resource in this area.  It's called <em><a href="http://beyondmeds.com/benzos/">Benzo Info</a>, </em>and is on Monica Cassani's blog, <a href="http://beyondmeds.com/">BeyondMeds</a>.

Monica has first-hand experience of benzodiazepine withdrawal, and her comments and suggestions are always helpful, supportive, and insightful.  She also provides a comprehensive list of links to other materials dealing with specific aspects of this problem, including forums and support groups.

Withdrawing from benzodiazepines can be dangerous, and in my view should entail medical supervision.  Monica makes the point that some physicians are not as knowledgeable in this area as they might be.  She writes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Sometimes the best we can do is find a doctor who is willing to learn with us. I was blessed with such a prescriber while I came off my cocktail."</p>
If you, or someone you know, is in this plight, or if you're just interested in this particular aspect of psycho-pharmaceutical destructiveness, this is a good site to peruse.
