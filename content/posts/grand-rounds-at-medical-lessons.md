Dr. Elaine Schattner has Grand Rounds this week at <a href="http://www.medicallessons.net/2011/07/med-blog-grand-rounds-takes-a-virtual-tour/">Medical Lessons</a>.  Not only has she put together some very interesting reading, but a range of photos from around the world.  In her call for submissions Dr. Schattner asked that bloggers submit a photo from their region, and she received some lovely images.  Have a look.
