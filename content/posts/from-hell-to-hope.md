<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1519" src="/images/tell-your-story.png" alt="This post was submitted by a reader." width="247" height="209" />   <span style="color: #222222;">Can.you tell I have a cat just by looking at me?  </span><span style="color: #222222;">Can you tell I have a mental illness just by looking at me?</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I began to change in my early teens, be it hormones and my shifting </span><span style="color: #222222;">brain chemistry, or the stress of my parents seperating. Something </span><span style="color: #222222;">stressor from the outside flipped on the switch to a new life filled </span><span style="color: #222222;">with major mood swings out of my control.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Low self extreme kept me from meeting or caring about being social. I </span><span style="color: #222222;">only went to school because I had to. Luckily one day two high school </span><span style="color: #222222;">girls came to my 8th grade health class and talked to us about </span><span style="color: #222222;">everything from Stress to Smoking to Sex even Suicide. They asked us </span><span style="color: #222222;">to write thrm a question about these topics and others. I wrote "I </span><span style="color: #222222;">want to die"It was the first time I admitted to myself or anyone else </span><span style="color: #222222;">that I had these thouhts constantly. When class was over the girls </span><span style="color: #222222;">kindly asked if I would like to talk to the counselor.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">That day was just the beginning of my journey towards understanding </span><span style="color: #222222;">mental illness, and ultimately accepting mental Wellness. Over the </span><span style="color: #222222;">next few years I spent time in psychiatric hospitals, tried medication </span><span style="color: #222222;">that would hopefully be the missing puzzle piece of chemistry my brain </span><span style="color: #222222;">needed. Most of the medications tried their best but caused the worst. </span><span style="color: #222222;">I never once stopped taking the medication I was prescribed, for I </span><span style="color: #222222;">never wanted to feel so completely out of control again. I realized I </span><span style="color: #222222;">was accepting my chemical imbalance and each day I began to understand </span><span style="color: #222222;">myself and my issues in a much lighter, hopeful way.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">The support I recieved on my journey towards wholness helped me </span><span style="color: #222222;">acknowledge I was a person not a problem. My mother was my life </span><span style="color: #222222;">support at times. She learned all she could about mood disorders and </span><span style="color: #222222;">educated our family so as not to judge me, but be very proud. I also </span><span style="color: #222222;">met some peers within the mental health community that I still keep in </span><span style="color: #222222;">touch with regularly. It was a blessing to know I was not alone in the </span><span style="color: #222222;">issues I faced. And that I would be accepted by my peers, for they had </span><span style="color: #222222;">experienced similar challenges.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I knew I had a message and a story to tell. I wanted to share my </span><span style="color: #222222;">experience From Hell to Hope with students. That is where my journey </span><span style="color: #222222;">began. So , with a father whose son has schizophrenia, and I, with my </span><span style="color: #222222;">rapid cycling moods we have spoken to over 4,000 high school students </span><span style="color: #222222;">since 2006.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">My hope is to stop stigma, treating people badly because they seem </span><span style="color: #222222;">different. I want to promote education of mental illness so people </span><span style="color: #222222;">suffering and their loved ones will believe recovery is real.</span>
