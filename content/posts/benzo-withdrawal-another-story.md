There's another benzo withdrawal story on Mad in America:  <i><a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/reality-clash-when-benzo-withdrawal-meets-parenthood/">The 99<sup>th</sup> Mile: When Benzo Withdrawal Meets Parenthood</a> </i> by Melissa Bond.

Melissa recounts that when her Down's syndrome son was 18 months old and her baby daughter was three months, she consulted a physician because of problems with insomnia and consequent exhaustion.  He prescribed 2 mg of Ativan daily, which he increased to 6 mg within six months.

Melissa describes in detail the problems of withdrawal, and the extreme measures she had to take to cope with this.

Whenever I read these kinds of stories, the question that comes to me is:  Who do these doctors think they are?  <strong>How can they imagine that these pills are going to make a positive contribution</strong> to someone who's trying to battle such daunting odds?

It's essentially the same as saying:  "I really can't do anything for you, but if you drink a pint of whiskey every evening, you'll sleep fine!"
