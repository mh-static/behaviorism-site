Earlier this year the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, an agency of the UN, passed a resolution “to develop a comprehensive action plan covering services, policies, plans, strategies, programs and legislation to enable persons with mental disorders to live a full and productive life in the community.”

The resolution recommends several strategies to promote mental health, including the integration of “…mental health into broader health policies and strategies…” and the promotion of “…mental health by targeting early childhood years, aging, prevention of domestic violence and abuse, workplace stress and suicide prevention programs.”

A comprehensive action plan is to be developed from the WHA resolution.

Just for the record, I’m not a UN basher.  In fact, I believe that its role as international peace-keeper is essential.  But the mental health resolution will simply result in global proliferation of the pill-for-every-problem disease-mongering that has already come to be accepted as normal in developed countries.

There’s one thing that psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies are really good at – <em>marketing</em>.
