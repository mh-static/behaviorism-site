There's a new post on Mick Bramham's website called "A time to grieve, a time to console, and a time to profit?"  You can see it <a href="http://blog.mythsandrisks.info/2013/04/a-time-to-grieve-time-to-console-and.html">here</a>.

You might have thought that, given the adverse publicity that pharma has been receiving in recent years, they would be easing up on their expansionist agenda.

But you would be wrong.  The <strong>APA has declared open season on bereavement</strong>, and although DSM-5 won't be released for a few more weeks, <strong>Eli Lilly is already grooming their SNRI Cymbalta as a "treatment"</strong> for this pseudo illness.

Mick's post mentions and critiques a study on the effectiveness of Cymbalta.  The study was conducted by John Shuster, MD.  According to <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;term=John+Shuster&amp;state%5Bid%5D=&amp;services%5B%5D=&amp;period%5B%5D=">Dollars for Docs</a>, Dr. Shuster received $15,000 from Eli Lilly in 2011.

Here's a quote from Mick's post:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In reality grief is not a sickness waiting for a cure; rather, it is a natural response to the loss that is an unavoidable part of life."</p>
It's a compelling article.  Please take a look.
