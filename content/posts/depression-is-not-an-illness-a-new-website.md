I've recently come across a new website that is challenging the illness approach to depression.

It's <a href="http://www.depressionwars.com/fight-depression-blog.html">depressionwars.com</a> and is written by Char Leander, an industrial sociologist.  Char became interested in this topic when she saw "…the epidemic of emotional disorders in the workplace."  She also recounts some personal experience with depression.

Here are some quotes from her November 11 post <a href="http://www.depressionwars.com/fight-back-against-depression.html">Fight Back Against Depression</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"You have to fight back against depression as disorder! The walls of depression may be high, but higher still are the invincible mental walls erected around the concepts of disorder, mental illness, and disease."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When you participate in societal cognition and reject the message of yourself as a defective cell, you change not only the way you are feeling, but influence the energy of the cells surrounding you."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is unlikely for you to pass into a new phase of development without depression, as that is what transpires when you face the changes taking place within you."</p>
Depressionwars.com is thoughtful, articulate, relevant, and well-written.  Please take a look.
