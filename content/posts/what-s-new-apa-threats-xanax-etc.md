Daniel Carlat’s <a href="http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/">blog</a> carries an <a href="http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/01/apa-threatens-to-sue-dsm5watch-website.html">interesting item</a>.  It seems that a lady named Suzy Chapman started a site called dsm5watch, in which she expressed criticism of the DSM.  Well, the APA didn’t like this and sent her a cease and desist letter, claiming that the string “DSM-5” is trademarked, and that she was infringing their rights.  She complied, changing the name of her site to <a href="http://dxrevisionwatch.wordpress.com/">dxrevisionwatch</a>.

What I find interesting here is that the APA claim to be interested in public comment.  I guess as long as it doesn’t get too critical.

Christopher Lane’s <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects">blog</a> has an <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201201/panic-disorder-in-the-age-anxiety">interesting piece</a> on how Upjohn promoted the concept of panic disorder in order to sell Xanax.

Xanax, incidentally, is the best-selling psychiatric drug in America.  I am reminded of a quip I heard from a psychiatrist many years ago.  “The difference between Xanax and true love is that Xanax is forever.”   He went on to explain – “you don’t take people off Xanax – once you’re on, you’re on!”
