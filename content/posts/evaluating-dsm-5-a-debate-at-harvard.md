<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">There's a <a href="http://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/events/details/evaluating-the-revised-DSM-5">debate</a> on this topic scheduled for 12:00 p.m., March 11, 2014, at Wasserstein Hall, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The event is free, and open to the public.</span>

The debate is sponsored by the Petrie-Flom Center For Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School.  This is the same group that produced the recent symposium on <a href="http://www.ethics.harvard.edu/lab/featured/325-jlme-symposium">Institutional Corruption and Pharmaceutical Policy</a>.

The debate will be moderated by I. Glen Cohen, Professor Law at Harvard and Co-Director of the Petri-Flom Center.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Panelists:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Steven E. Hyman, Director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute and Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Anne Becker, Maude and Lillian Presley Professor of Global Health and Medicine, Harvard Medical School<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Nita Farahany, Professor of Law, Professor of Genome Sciences &amp; Policy, and Professor of Philosophy at Duke University<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></li>
</ul>
It is encouraging that these kinds of issues are being discussed.  Readers living in the Cambridge area might like to attend, but I imagine that the Petri-Flom Center will publish transcripts/summaries after the event, for general release.
