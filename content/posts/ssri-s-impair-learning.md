There's an interesting article on Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience.  It's called<em><a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Learning-from-Negative-Feedback-SSRI.pdf"> Learning from Negative Feedback in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder is Attenuated by SSRI Antidepressants</a></em>.

The researchers evaluated learning ability in three groups:
<ul>
	<li>medication-naïve individuals who met the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder</li>
	<li>individuals who met the criteria for MDD and were receiving the SSRI paroxetine (Paxil)</li>
	<li>"healthy" controls</li>
</ul>
All subjects were given a learning task that allowed the researchers to distinguish learning from positive feedback versus learning from negative feedback

The results were:
<ul>
	<li>the "healthy" controls learned better from positive feedback than either of the depressed groups</li>
	<li>the individuals taking the SSRI learned <i>less</i> from <i>negative</i> feedback than either of the other groups</li>
</ul>
To quote from the authors:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This suggests that SSRI antidepressants impair learning from negative feedback…"</p>
Learning from negative consequences is a very important component of navigating our way through the social and other complexities of life.  Any impairment in this area is not trivial, and <strong>this may well be a contributing factor to poor long-term outcome that is associated with the use of antidepressants</strong>.
