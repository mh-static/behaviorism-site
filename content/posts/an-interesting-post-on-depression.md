There’s some interesting reading at <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/04/06/frightening-story-behind-the-drug-companies-creation-of-medical-lobotomies.aspx">Mercola.com</a> posted April 6, 2011.

Dr. Mercola states that depression is not an illness! - and that this bogus illness was created by psychiatrists and drug companies in order to sell drugs!

No surprises there for regular readers of this site.  Unfortunately Dr. Mercola doesn’t take the logic far enough.  Although he rightly debunks depression as an illness, he clings to the notion that other “mental illnesses” are bona fide.

But the encouraging thing is that people are beginning to see that the emperor has no clothes. Pass it on.
