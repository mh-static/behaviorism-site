A few months ago, I became aware of various articles online that stated "Robert F Kennedy Jr. says 70% of news advertising revenue comes from Big Pharma".  In the articles there is a link to a <a href="http://www.ora.tv/offthegrid/2015/5/18/grid-robert--kennedy-jr-takes-big-pharma--vaccine-industry-0_6ck7ne6j25bv">May 18, 2015 video</a> in which Jesse Ventura, former Governor of Minnesota, interviews Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on an episode of Off the Grid.  Off the Grid is a talk show on Ora.tv, an online network.

Here's the RFK Jr. quote from the video:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I ate breakfast last week with the president of a network news division and he told me that during non-election years, 70% of the advertising revenues for his news division come from pharmaceutical ads. And if you go on TV any night and watch the network news, you’ll see they become just a vehicle for selling pharmaceuticals. He also told me that he would fire a host who brought onto his station a guest who lost him a pharmaceutical account,"</p>
One of the things that's most striking about pharma-psychiatry is that although it is based on a colossal hoax, and does an enormous amount of harm, it receives little critical attention from the mainstream media.  Mr. Kennedy's comment helps us understand this silence.

Here's another quote from an <a href="http://www.trueactivist.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-70-of-news-advertising-revenue-comes-from-big-pharma/">article on trueactivist.com</a>, June 1, 2015:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"This deceptive strategy proved to be quite lucrative so the drug companies launched a massive advertising campaign to peddle a wide variety of ineffective and unnecessary drugs to a trusting and ignorant public. This industry actually spends more money on advertising than they do on research and development every single year."</p>
Pharma, in effect, buys the media's silence by pumping enormous sums of money  into advertising.

But in the last two or three years, we have seen more and more criticism of pharma-psychiatry in the media.  Here's a short list of some mainstream media outlets that have taken pharma-psychiatry to task in recent years:

<strong>Scientific American</strong>, John Horgan:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"So many medical professionals benefit from overprescribing that it is difficult to find a neutral source of information. Prominent doctors get paid by drug companies to deliver upbeat messages to their colleagues at forums where they typically exaggerate the effectiveness of the drugs and downplay their side effects. Organizations that advocate on behalf of patients often do so with money supplied by drug companies, including the makers of A.D.H.D. stimulants. Medical researchers paid by drug companies have published studies on the benefits of the drugs, and medical journals in a position to question their findings profit greatly from advertising of A.D.H.D. drugs."</p>

Let us hope that this trend will continue, and that the media will increase their scrutiny and exposure of what is arguably the biggest and most destructive hoax in human history.  If you see an article critical of psychiatry's abuses in a newspaper or other media outlet, please consider sending comments of appreciation to the writer and the editor.
