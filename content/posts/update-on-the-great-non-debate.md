Yesterday I received the following comment from Dr. Huda, who, believe it or not, still seems to be under the impression that I want to debate him on Twitter!
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Hi I don't read your blog so only found out about this from someone else Debates on social media are usually a non meeting of minds and a waste of time</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In any case they don't demonstrate your understanding of psychiatry just debating skills</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I am writing (slowly) a book on the medical model and mental health which of it ever comes out you are free to read to see what I think are the concepts underpinning psychiatry</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All the best"</p>
So, to set the record straight – <em>again </em>– let me clarify matters.  On August 7, Dr. Huda stated on Twitter that I hate psychiatry, and that I get its concepts wrong.  My invitation to Dr. Huda is that he elaborate on this contention by critiquing any of my writings and pointing out my errors.  I have specifically stated in two previous posts that Twitter would <em>not</em> be a suitable medium for this.  He may enter his critique in one of my comments sections or any other venue of his choice.

My invitation is still open, and my promise to respond still stands.
