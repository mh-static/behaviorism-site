There's an important article (<a href="http://beyondmeds.com/2013/05/07/interview-john-nash/">here</a>) on Monica Cassani's website <a href="http://beyondmeds.com/">BeyondMeds</a> in which she tackles the myth that once a person has been assigned a "diagnosis" of schizophrenia, he/she must take neuroleptics for life.

Here's a quote:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Unfortunately, at this juncture in history many people who get labeled with psychiatric illness these days do not have the opportunity for recovery because they are encouraged to stay ill by a system that all too often impedes psychological growth by use of excessive psychotropic drugs. This over-use of medication also kills people. The average life-span of people taking these medications is 25 years shorter than people who do not take these drugs. The drugs cause a long laundry list of problems only some of which are diabetes, obesity, heart conditions and a shrinking brain."</p>
Given the <strong>devastating effects of neuroleptic drugs</strong>, including premature death, the schizophrenia falsehood is arguably the most damaging facet of modern psychiatry.
