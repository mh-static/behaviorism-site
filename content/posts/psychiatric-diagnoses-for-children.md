Today, courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds">Monica</a>, I came across an article by Marilyn Wedge, PhD.  It's called <i>Six Problems with Psychiatric Diagnosis for Children. </i>  You can read it <a href="http://beyondmeds.com/2012/10/08/psych-dx-for-children/">here.</a>

Here are some quotes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Psychiatric diagnoses contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders are not classified by causes like genuine medical diseases."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Perhaps worst of all, a child who has been labeled with a psychiatric diagnosis grows up believing that there is something wrong with her, that she is somehow “abnormal.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Psychiatric labeling and medicating have tragically become the mainstream way of dealing with difficult, mischievous and overly imaginative children in our pill-popping culture."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"></p>
The article is succinct, accurate, and to-the-point.  Please read it and pass or tweet it on.
