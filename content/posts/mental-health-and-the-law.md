The central theme of this website is that there are no mental illnesses, and that the widespread medicalization of ordinary human problems is spurious and destructive.  These concepts have been around for decades, but in the last four or five years have "taken off," and are finding a good deal of acceptance among practitioners, academics, clients, and the general public.  Change is in the air.

A matter that is sometimes overlooked, however, is that the <strong>concept of "mental illness" and its "treatment" by psychiatrists and other professionals is deeply embedded in the legal system of most states and countries</strong>.

There are laws concerning:  involuntary commitments; "mental" disabilities; criminal culpability; funding for "mental illness" programs; housing of people with "mental illnesses," etc…

Critiquing the status quo from conceptual and practical perspectives is important, and is clearly having an effect, but <strong>efforts also need to be directed towards effecting legal changes</strong>.

In this regard, I have, by courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/yobluemama2">Becky</a> on Twitter, become aware of a group called <a href="http://repealmentalhealthlaws.org/">Repeal Mental Health Laws</a>.  Their primary objective is the repeal of laws that allow for involuntary commitment.  I encourage you to check out their site, offer them encouragement, and if you can, join their efforts.

I have no doubt that future generations, looking back on the 20<sup>th</sup> century, will identify the involuntary incarceration and forced "treatment" of people with "mental illnesses," the way we look back on the witch trials.
