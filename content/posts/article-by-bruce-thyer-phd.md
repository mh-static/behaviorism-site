I came across an interesting article the other day.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It Is Time to Rename the DSM, </em>by Bruce A. Thyer, PhD, Florida State University, Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry, Vol 8, No. 1, Spring 2006</p>
Dr. Thyer points out that although the DSM claims to be atheoretical, its contention that the various “mental illnesses” reside <em>within the individual</em>, as opposed, for instance, to being understandable reactions to adverse life events, is in itself a theoretical stance.

Dr. Thyer also points out that in the manual’s description of conduct disorder there is a little known (and in my experience even less used) caveat to the effect that this so-called diagnosis should not be assigned if the misbehavior is “…simply a reaction to the immediate social context.”  This is laudable, of course, on the part of the APA, but Dr. Thyer goes on to pose the obvious question:  Why is this exclusion not applied to <em>all</em> the conditions listed? He then answers his own question:  Because “…if this practice was followed, the very concept of <em>mental disorders</em> threatens to evaporate, in favor of viewing these as environmentally driven phenomena.”

So, there it is – an important article on a very important topic.  It’s six years old.  I don’t know why I hadn’t found it earlier.  I encourage you to read it.
