<img class="alignleft wp-image-1519 size-full" src="/images/tell-your-story.png" alt="This post was submitted by a reader." width="247" height="209" />My neice living in a townhouse complex - has reached the following stage:-
1-complete isolation from anybody even her sisters.
2-will not acknowledge her illness and will not accept any medication whatsoever.
3-will not allow anybody into her home.
4-all the symptons of Schizoid Personality Disorder
5-threatening to all and considers everyone responsible for her divorce that she went through several years ago.

What can be done forcibly by a specialist legally to get her to obtain treatment.

It has reached a stage where her finances will be exhausted and that it is believed that she might be considering drastic bodily harm.  She is 52 years old - any help in what should be done would be greatly appreciated.
