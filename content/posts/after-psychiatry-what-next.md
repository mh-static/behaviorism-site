I ended a recent post arguing that psychiatrists should not have a leadership role in whatever kind of helping program eventually replaces the present mental health system, which is crumbling at the seams, conceptually and practically.

So the question arises – which profession <em>is</em> suited to a leadership role.  Of course, this begs the question – do we need any kind of formal helping system at all.  Perhaps what we should be doing as a society is strengthening the natural mutually-helpful bonds that already exist within our culture.  I can see a lot of merit in that position, and it may be that this is what will eventually happen.  But I don’t think it can happen right away.

As a psychologist, I would like to be able to say that psychologists are the clear choice for leadership once the psychiatrists have shuffled shamefully to the wings, but I find myself unable to say this with any confidence.  Psychologists, at least in America, have individually and through their professional associations repeatedly and consistently endorsed the spurious medical model to a degree that seriously undermines our credibility.

My choice – for what it’s worth – to lead a newly-conceptualized demedicalized helping profession would be<strong> social workers</strong>.  Of all the various professions represented in the field, they are most intimately<strong> aware of the social forces that drive so much counterproductive behavior</strong>.  In addition, the notion of a client-centered approach is, in my experience, more deeply embedded in their professional culture than is the case in other professions.  They are - again in my experience – pragmatic, practical, solution-oriented, and realistic.  They don’t just sit in offices and accept the client’s “office behavior” at face value.  They visit clients in their homes and are intimately familiar with the <strong>environmental forces that underlie human problems.</strong>

They have also – and perhaps this is the critical point – kept themselves at least somewhat aloof from the nonsense, venality, and destructiveness of the present bio-psychiatric-pharma industry
