Another interesting article:  <a href="http://leoniefennell.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/academic-integrity-in-ireland-and-the-uk-is-there-any-such-thing/">Academic Integrity in Ireland and the UK: Is there any such thing?</a> at Leonie fennells' Blog.

Thanks to Becky @yobluemama2 on Twitter for drawing my attention to this.
