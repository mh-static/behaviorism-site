<span style="color: #222222;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1519" src="/images/tell-your-story.png" alt="This post was submitted by a reader." width="247" height="209" />I'm a 29-year-old man with a story I've been wanting to share for a </span><span style="color: #222222;">while now.  It's not a story of misery or desperation, for which I am </span><span style="color: #222222;">every day grateful.  More a story of dissatisfaction, occasional </span><span style="color: #222222;">crisis, and a desire to understand this whole affair of mental health.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">My upbringing was all a person could ask for, a loving and stable </span><span style="color: #222222;">family and a fair degree of academic success.  If anything was missing, </span><span style="color: #222222;">it was simply the acknowledgement that sometimes people get depressed, </span><span style="color: #222222;">anxious, or otherwise mad, and that madness in itself is a natural </span><span style="color: #222222;">part of life, for some of us more than others.</span>

<span style="color: #222222;">As a kid, then teenager, I was sufficiently busy aspiring to be </span><span style="color: #222222;">'normal' like my family that I didn't really try to tackle the idea </span><span style="color: #222222;">that there might be a label for me.  Not until I started university, </span><span style="color: #222222;">and started to leave my classes halfway through due to panic attacks.  </span><span style="color: #222222;">So I went to the first and only place I could think to go, the </span><span style="color: #222222;">university clinic.  I lucked into a very good GP there, who suggested </span><span style="color: #222222;">to me the labels of Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety </span><span style="color: #222222;">Disorder- I carried those terms around in my back pocket for several </span><span style="color: #222222;">years, sometimes as excuses, but more often as a means of convincing </span><span style="color: #222222;">myself that I was not broken, or at least broken in the same way as </span><span style="color: #222222;">many other people were.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Looking back I realize a lot of things: that I was never actually </span><span style="color: #222222;">formally diagnosed with anything; that both of those 'disorders' are </span><span style="color: #222222;">actually as common as dirt; and that, despite the official and </span><span style="color: #222222;">scientific-sounding names, there was no science behind my diagnoses.</span>

<span style="color: #222222;">A couple years ago I decided to ply my scholarly tendencies to </span><span style="color: #222222;">understanding mental illness, hoping that armed with some </span><span style="color: #222222;">understanding I may be able to help others, or at least help myself.  </span><span style="color: #222222;">So, I enrolled in a master's degree in neuroscience with a </span><span style="color: #222222;">psychiatrist as my supervisor, my primary intention being to learn all </span><span style="color: #222222;">about the science of mental health, and experience 'the system' from </span><span style="color: #222222;">the inside.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I haven't much covered my own symptoms or my own experience, because </span><span style="color: #222222;">the story I really want to tell is of how pragmatically clueless are </span><span style="color: #222222;">many of the people who actually do the research.  Out here in the </span><span style="color: #222222;">world, we question (and rightly so) the validity of the DSM.  We wonder </span><span style="color: #222222;">if it serves us well, and we are highly concerned about the fact that </span><span style="color: #222222;">such a powerful and influential document is so flawed.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">On the inside of the research machine though, where such conversations </span><span style="color: #222222;">should be taking place constantly, we are miserably silent.  We treat </span><span style="color: #222222;">the DSM as received wisdom, probably more because it would be highly </span><span style="color: #222222;">inconvenient to do otherwise than because we actually believe the </span><span style="color: #222222;">hype.  Yet, the fact remains that the first thing that happens in any </span><span style="color: #222222;">clinical study is the handing out of diagnoses (this person is </span><span style="color: #222222;">bipolar, that one obsessive-compulsive); we then enrol 'controls' who </span><span style="color: #222222;">do not have the particular disorder we're interested in, and that's </span><span style="color: #222222;">the end of the diagnosis question.  We treat the DSM categories as real </span><span style="color: #222222;">entities like cancer or diabetes, and because we all assume they are </span><span style="color: #222222;">real, they become real, everywhere except in the sufferer's head, the </span><span style="color: #222222;">only place it matters.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">My point is not to support or dispute the DSM; many wiser minds than </span><span style="color: #222222;">mine have done this.  My point is that in mental health research, the </span><span style="color: #222222;">place where this controversial topic is supremely important, we're not </span><span style="color: #222222;">even talking about it.  In fact I often find myself educating others </span><span style="color: #222222;">about the most basic elements: did you know that the NIMH is not going </span><span style="color: #222222;">to use the DSM for research anymore?  Did you know that Allen Frances, </span><span style="color: #222222;">the chair of the DSM-IV committee, has been telling everyone who'll </span><span style="color: #222222;">listen all about the ridiculous and awful things that are happening at </span><span style="color: #222222;">the American Psychiatric Association?  Are you even the slightest bit </span><span style="color: #222222;">aware that our 'bible' of psychiatric diagnosis is hugely </span><span style="color: #222222;">controversial?</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">These are conversations I might expect to have with teenagers, not </span><span style="color: #222222;">with 'mental health experts', and sadly it's not because of my </span><span style="color: #222222;">training that I know about these things, rather because of my own </span><span style="color: #222222;">personal interest.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">It's particularly alarming to me on a personal level that these </span><span style="color: #222222;">people, even more than the average, it seems, are oblivious to the </span><span style="color: #222222;">mental health of those around them.  Occasionally I go through </span><span style="color: #222222;">depressive episodes in which I become markedly more irritable, sleepy, </span><span style="color: #222222;">and unfocused. I sleep late, I have much less to say than I usually </span><span style="color: #222222;">do, I fidget constantly.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I can't imagine it's that hard to pick up the difference when it comes </span><span style="color: #222222;">on for a month or two or three, then goes away again, yet none of my </span><span style="color: #222222;">coworkers ever noticed, or if they did they didn't feel the need to </span><span style="color: #222222;">fire off a quick, "hey, are you doing okay? Wanna talk?"</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">So at the same time as I'm having deep conversations about depression </span><span style="color: #222222;">and the meaning of life with my roommates, my wife, my friends, and </span><span style="color: #222222;">the occasional stranger, not a word is mentioned by or to any of the </span>psychiatrists, psychologists, or other professionals I'm surrounded by every day.  People who, technically anyway, should have a lot more to say on the subject.  If I had been more ill, if, say, I had ended up committing suicide, I can imagine these people scratching their heads raw and saying things like "no, of course I didn't see it coming! He seemed so nice..."

<span style="color: #222222;">There is a very powerful 'us and them' mentality within mental health </span><span style="color: #222222;">research- it's the patients who have a problem, not us, never us.  This </span><span style="color: #222222;">thinking is so problematic, damaging, hypocritical, and just plain </span><span style="color: #222222;">wrong I don't even know where to begin.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">For my part, I approach the whole thing by being as open as I possibly </span><span style="color: #222222;">can without actually wearing an "I have a mental illness" sash around </span><span style="color: #222222;">the office.  I have since discovered that others in my office have </span><span style="color: #222222;">struggles and diagnoses of their own, but they either haven't felt </span><span style="color: #222222;">comfortable telling anyone, or they haven't felt safe.  I suppose the </span><span style="color: #222222;">logic goes, once 'we' admit to such problems, we are no better than </span><span style="color: #222222;">'them'.  Personally, I always felt a lot more comfortable hanging out </span><span style="color: #222222;">with 'them' anyway.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Here's one interaction that struck me as particularly funny in a </span><span style="color: #222222;">depressing kind of way.  A few months ago the person in the desk next </span><span style="color: #222222;">to mine (soon to be a psychiatry resident), asked me if I wanted to be </span><span style="color: #222222;">a control subject in her depression study. I informed her that I'd </span><span style="color: #222222;">love to, but I wasn't eligible: I not only had the disorder in </span><span style="color: #222222;">question, but was on the drugs for it too!  I watched a panoply of </span><span style="color: #222222;">emotions play across her face, eventually settling on something like </span><span style="color: #222222;">pity. "I'm so sorry, I had no idea! If it makes you feel any better, I </span><span style="color: #222222;">never would have known if you didn't say something!" </span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Actually, soon-to-be-a-psychiatrist, that doesn't make me feel better.  </span><span style="color: #222222;">I am no master of deception, and if you hope to be even vaguely </span><span style="color: #222222;">competent in your profession, you should have known.  You should have </span><span style="color: #222222;">known, and you shouldn't have acted like I was stricken with some </span><span style="color: #222222;">horrible affliction, deserving of your pity.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">So to attempt to summarize, I've spent a lot of time in mental health </span><span style="color: #222222;">research and here's what I've learned.  The scientists don't know much </span><span style="color: #222222;">when it comes to diagnosis or treatment of mental illness, so take </span><span style="color: #222222;">everything they say with a grain of salt.  In real world terms of what </span><span style="color: #222222;">mental illness looks like and how one should approach it, many know </span><span style="color: #222222;">even less.  Despite all the talk of stigma reduction, I have </span><span style="color: #222222;">experienced mental health stigma most strongly among the very people </span><span style="color: #222222;">who are talking about stigma reduction, so it's possible that current </span><span style="color: #222222;">approaches aren't working.  And lastly, just because a thing sounds </span><span style="color: #222222;">scientific, don't mean it is.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">On the flipside, there are definitely psychiatrists, psychologists, </span><span style="color: #222222;">therapists, etc. out there who are very good at what they do, who </span><span style="color: #222222;">genuinely care about helping people, and who do a lot of just that.  I </span><span style="color: #222222;">met a lot of those along the way too, and I have huge respect for </span><span style="color: #222222;">them.  What they do is a kind of art, it takes heart and a lot of </span><span style="color: #222222;">expertise, the stakes are high, and the job is very hard. It's just </span><span style="color: #222222;">not science, that's all.  I no longer assume, solely on the basis of a </span><span style="color: #222222;">fancy degree or prestigious job that a person actually knows </span><span style="color: #222222;">anything.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">What I learned by studying clinical neuroscience and psychiatry was </span><span style="color: #222222;">not exactly what I expected- I sure learned a lot more about what we </span><span style="color: #222222;">don't know than what we do know.  So I'm going to stick with my </span><span style="color: #222222;">friendly kitchen-table therapy among those I love, my drugs that work </span><span style="color: #222222;">sometimes even though no one knows why, and my acceptance of the fact </span><span style="color: #222222;">that sometimes in life, you just can't get out of bed and that's okay.</span>
