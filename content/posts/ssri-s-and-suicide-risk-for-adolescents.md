This issue has been debated for years, but was finally considered to have been put to rest by NIMH’s 2004 Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS).  This study essentially “found” that fluoxetine (Prozac) was effective in treating depression and did not involve an increased risk of suicide.

Robert Whitaker’s most recent <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mad-in-america/201202/the-real-suicide-data-the-tads-study-comes-light">post</a> points out that TADS actually found that adolescents treated with fluoxetine had a markedly higher risk for suicidal activity than those who received a placebo.  Robert also outlines the various statistical and methodological ploys that were used to conceal this finding and to sanitize the final report.

It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the deception was deliberate
