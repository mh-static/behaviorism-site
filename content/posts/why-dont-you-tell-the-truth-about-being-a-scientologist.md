<td colspan="2" valign="top">Jaymax,Thanks for coming in.Firstly, the only common ground between Scientologists and me is the fact that we criticize modern psychiatry. Our reasons are very different.Secondly, I don't rant.

Thirdly, perhaps my knowledge of the field is outdated and lacking. I certainly don't claim to know everything. The critical question, however, is this – <i>specifically</i> what errors am I making? What am I missing? What am I getting wrong? Attacking me because I'm "outdated" serves no purpose. Snidely questioning my commitment to education gets us nowhere. Instead, provide me <i>one piece</i> of hard evidence that contradicts my position. One fact is better than a thousand ad hominem attacks.

Best wishes.</td>
