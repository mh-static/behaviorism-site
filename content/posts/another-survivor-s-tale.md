<span style="color: #222222;">My Story</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1519" src="/images/tell-your-story.png" alt="This post was submitted by a reader." width="247" height="209" />

<span style="color: #222222;">I tried to commit suicide for the first time when I was 15. I spent my </span><span style="color: #222222;">16th birthday locked up in Dammasch State Mental Hospital, I freaked </span><span style="color: #222222;">out when I was told I was going to have to stay so my clothes were </span><span style="color: #222222;">ripped off me, by male aids and I was thrown naked in a real padded </span><span style="color: #222222;">room... hint they are NOT padded. The light was on all the time and </span><span style="color: #222222;">nothing was provided for cover to keep warm. I remember seeing men </span><span style="color: #222222;">looking at me and I remember pictures being taken thru the peek hole </span><span style="color: #222222;">window. I was in that room, with meals shoved thru a slit in the door </span><span style="color: #222222;">for 3 days. The toilet was a hole in the floor and no, there wasn't </span><span style="color: #222222;">any toilet paper. . While at the "hospital", I remember being put in a </span><span style="color: #222222;">strait jacket and tied into a chair and my "meds" forced down my </span><span style="color: #222222;">throat. When I realized I could vomit them back up I was sedated and </span><span style="color: #222222;">given drugs via an IV. I woke up to being raped. I made friends with </span><span style="color: #222222;">one gal, she was 14. She had ( I know know as ) anorexia. I watched </span><span style="color: #222222;">her try and try and try to eat. She died. Another person I made </span><span style="color: #222222;">friends with hung himself and died. The psy dr said I was on the </span><span style="color: #222222;">schedule for shock treatments since I refused to co-operate with the </span><span style="color: #222222;">rules and the staff. That scared the shit outta me. I started doing </span><span style="color: #222222;">all the things I was supposed to do and 3 months later I was </span><span style="color: #222222;">released.. cured. Nothing was different for me, except I learned how </span><span style="color: #222222;">to manipulate people to get what I wanted. I HATED that feeling so I </span><span style="color: #222222;">never took "advantage" of that "skill".. Remember I had just turned </span><span style="color: #222222;">16.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">In my early 20's I tried to commit suicide again and committed to </span><span style="color: #222222;">another hosp in Vancouver WA with a DX of Manic Depression. I was on a </span><span style="color: #222222;">cocktail of lithium, stelazine, tofranil chloral hydrate and a few </span><span style="color: #222222;">others I can't remember the names of .. for more than 7 years I saw a </span><span style="color: #222222;">psychiatrist until my divorce and my insurance ran out. Dumped to fare </span><span style="color: #222222;">the best I could into the mental health system for the poor I quit all </span><span style="color: #222222;">my drugs cold turkey.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">It was while under the Dr's care I read a book he recommended called </span><span style="color: #222222;">Self-Talk. I believed I was sick with metal illness(es?) until I read </span><span style="color: #222222;">that book. For the first time I heard no one can make me feel anyway </span><span style="color: #222222;">at all unless I choose to let them. That my responses to life were </span><span style="color: #222222;">totally under my control and direction ALL of them. I was 32. </span><span style="color: #222222;"> I've attempted suicide or came very very close to it 6 times in my </span><span style="color: #222222;">life. Finally I asked myself, self, I'm smart enough to have gotten </span><span style="color: #222222;">the job done so whats REALLY going on? I figured out WHY I kept diving </span><span style="color: #222222;">into the back hole. I really do walk a different, road now thanks to </span><span style="color: #222222;">getting the message my subconscious kept sending me. Thats been my </span><span style="color: #222222;">experience with the Mental Health system. I am continually agast and </span><span style="color: #222222;">appalled at the amount of drugs being forced onto people, particularly </span><span style="color: #222222;">children, We adults have been fed a line of BS for so long about </span><span style="color: #222222;">depression that it's destroying us as a nation and no one can see it.</span>
