<span style="color: #222222;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1519" src="/images/tell-your-story.png" alt="This post was submitted by a reader." width="247" height="209" />I was searching Google for effects of propaganda on the human psych, </span><span style="color: #222222;">and stumbled upon this site. After reading a few stories, I felt I had </span><span style="color: #222222;">to share my own. </span>

<span style="color: #222222;">When I was in high school I was depressed. To the point where I was a </span><span style="color: #222222;">walking text book definition. Failing grades, poor hygiene, isolation. </span><span style="color: #222222;">All the signs were obvious.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I had to go to rehab for drinking too much cough syrup.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">When I went to the doctor he diagnosed me with ADHD. I have never been </span><span style="color: #222222;">a hyper person. always rather slow and calm.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Than he tells me that he is going to just experiment with multiple </span><span style="color: #222222;">drugs to see what works, and than diagnose me with whatever that drug </span><span style="color: #222222;">treats.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">First drug was Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate)</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Its a new "abuse-free" amphetamine. Due to a coating of protein, the </span><span style="color: #222222;">chemical can only dissolve in your stomach acid. Injecting, Smoking, </span><span style="color: #222222;">or Snorting would not activate it.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">However the prescribed dose taken once a day was enough to make me a </span><span style="color: #222222;">full effect of amphetamines, and I began losing alot of sleep. After </span><span style="color: #222222;">having multiple panic attacks on this medication, I demanded the </span><span style="color: #222222;">doctor take me off of it.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">He than gave me Focalin (Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride)</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Another new "abuse-free" drug. During my younger years I experimented </span><span style="color: #222222;">with MDMA, and I would compare the feeling of Focalin with that of </span><span style="color: #222222;">Extacy.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">When I got into college my doctor pulled me off of it saying that </span><span style="color: #222222;">college kids are more likely to sell it, and that he must change my </span><span style="color: #222222;">prescription.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Next drug was Strattera (atomoxetine). I threw up every time I took </span><span style="color: #222222;">it. It gave me intense piriods of happiness followed by extreme bursts </span><span style="color: #222222;">of anger for no reason at all.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I stopped going to the doctor, I stopped taking medications. I no </span><span style="color: #222222;">longer trust the medical system, the pharm companies, or even the </span><span style="color: #222222;">government. I'd rather suffer the depression untreated than go through </span><span style="color: #222222;">what I went through in high school.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">On a side note, The experience made me drop out of school, and get my </span><span style="color: #222222;">GED. That year, my school experienced a higher drop out rate than ever </span><span style="color: #222222;">before.</span>
