There's a <a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/12/16/my-story-schizoid-personality/">new entry</a> on the Tell Your Story section of my website.

The author, who wishes to remain anonymous, tells how during his teenage years, his social skills were poor, and he met the criteria for schizoid personality disorder, the essential features of which are social isolation and emotional detachment.

Here are two quotes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"By the end of this project I had developed solid social skills, created an interesting circle of friends and no longer met the criteria for 'schizoid personality disorder'. This is without any psychiatry, medication, or even the knowledge that I was 'suffering' from something that many consider a 'disorder'."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"My 'disorder' could accurately be described as a lack of social skills remedied by proper training in a safe environment, not much unlike an inability to speak French."</p>
The entry is brief and well worth reading.Â  Its <strong>message is positive and empowering</strong>, and stands in marked contrast to the disempowering quality of psychiatric "diagnoses."
