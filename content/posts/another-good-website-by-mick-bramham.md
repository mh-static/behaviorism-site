I recently came across <i>Thinking About Mental Health: Myths, treatment risks &amp; alternatives.</i>  You can find it <a href="http://www.mythsandrisks.info/">here</a>.

It's written by Mick Bramham, from Dorset, England.

Here are some quotes:

From the post <a href="http://www.mythsandrisks.info/chemical-imbalances.html">Depression: Serotonin Imbalance?</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The whole idea of antidepressants supposedly correcting chemical imbalances has more to do with drug company marketing than evidence-based science."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Unfortunately, drug companies are known to exaggerate the benefits of their products and to play down the risks;"</p>
And from the post <a href="http://www.mythsandrisks.info/our-lives-in-context.html">Understanding our lives in context</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If we are feeling sad it is likely that something has happened that makes us feel sad."</p>
It's all excellent stuff and well presented.  Definitely worth following.
