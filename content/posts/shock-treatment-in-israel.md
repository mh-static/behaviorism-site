I've recently come across (courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/TallaTrialogue">Tallaght Trialogue on Twitter</a>) an article titled: <i><a href="http://occupypsychiatry.net/2013/130804IsraeliCtSaysNoForcedElectroshock.htm">The Court: Electroshock treatments should not be forced on psychiatric patients</a>.</i>  The original was in Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, and was written by Edna Adato.  The English version above was on occupypsychiatry.net, and was translated by <a href="https://twitter.com/RealJannaWeiss">Janna Weiss</a>.

The article is brief, and the content is straightforward.  As a result of a recent Israeli court ruling, electric shock treatment will not be administered against a person's will, even if the person has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital.

This is a victory for humanity and for decency.  A step on the road towards<strong> treating people as <i>people </i>rather than as broken brains</strong>, and towards abandoning destructive "treatments" that have no proven value.<i></i>
