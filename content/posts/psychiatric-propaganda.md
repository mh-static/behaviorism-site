Recently I received a very nice email from Laura Chapman.  Here's the text:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Hi there,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My name is Laura and I am emailing because I recently produced a guide on postpartum depression and wanted to share it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Here is the guide I have helped to make - <a href="http://www.psychguides.com/guides/living-with-postpartum-depression/http:/www.psychguides.com/guides/living-with-postpartum-depression/">http://www.psychguides.com/guides/living-with-postpartum-depression/http://www.psychguides.com/guides/living-with-postpartum-depression/</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Earlier this year a friend of mine suffered from maternity blues shortly after giving birth to her first child. Coaxing her through it, as I've had two children of my own, made me think about postpartum depression. It got me thinking about what advice or information to give new mothers and their family.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Please let me know what you think about the guide and whether it makes for a good resource on your site - behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/24/postpartum-depression/. If you would like me to write a short intro to the piece for your own site, just let me know.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Regards,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Laura"</p>
I don't know anybody by that name, and although the email has a warm, fuzzy, personalized tone, I suspect it was mass-mailed to any blog that contained the string "postpartum depression."  (I wrote a piece on this topic on April 24 last year, and so I got the email.)

Anyway, I opened the psychguides.com link and took a look at the <a href="http://www.psychguides.com/guides/living-with-postpartum-depression/">article</a> (guide) that Laura apparently helped create.  The letter-heading on the article page says:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5203" src="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/PsychGuides2.jpg" alt="PsychGuides2" width="457" height="250" />

Here are some quotes from Laura's article:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Antidepressants come in different forms, and there has been no evidence of these medications causing problems for nursing infants. If the depression is severe, medical professionals may urge a new mother to take medications to help treat the chemical imbalance in her brain. If a woman has become severely depressed and is having thoughts of suicide or psychotic thoughts, a doctor may want to keep her hospitalized to ensure her and her baby’s health and safety. Another rare type of treatment is electroconvulsive therapy, which doctors sometimes use when mothers do not want to take drugs or medications."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For extremely severe depression with psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, an antidepressant may be combined with an antipsychotic like Haldol, Risperdal, or Zyprexa."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Women who aren’t treated for postpartum depression can have a negative effect on their children. Studies have shown that depressed mothers interact less with their children, which can impact the children’s later behavior."</p>
PSYCHGUIDES

All of this aroused my curiosity, of course, so I checked out <a href="http://www.psychguides.com/">PsychGuides' website</a>, and found that they have a library of 115 articles on 24 different topics.  Here are the titles of some of the other articles, and some interesting quotes:

<a href="http://www.psychguides.com/guides/bipolar-disorder-symptoms-causes-and-effects/">Bipolar Disorder Symptoms, Causes and Effects</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Medical experts have also isolated certain chemicals in the brain that are believed to play a role in the chemical imbalance that causes mood swings. Those chemicals are serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline. According to researchers, if the levels of these chemicals are out of balance in your body, it could lead to the symptoms associated with bipolar disorder."</p>
<a href="http://www.psychguides.com/guides/bipolar-disorder/">Bipolar Disorder</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Along with mood stabilizers, the doctor might also prescribe antianxiety medications or antipsychotics to handle mood issues. Antidepressants are also used to help the patient deal with the depressive phases. The use of antidepressants raises the likelihood of experiencing hypomanic or manic periods, so they are usually used in conjunction with mood stabilizers. For those patients who do not respond to medicine, electroconvulsive therapy might be used. This therapy consists of electrical currents applied to the patient while under anesthesia and will cause brief seizures when used. After the electroconvulsive therapy application, the physician may also use transcranial magnetic stimulation, which applies magnetic pulses of a high frequency to the patient’s brain."</p>
<a href="http://www.psychguides.com/guides/depressive-disorder-in-older-patients/">Depressive Disorder in Older Patients</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Major depressive disorder is one of the most serious mood disorders. About 1 to 2 percent of people over the age of 65 face this condition. These people may have had depression in their younger years, but for some, this will be the first episode."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"While sadness and some depression are expected in these situations, a physician should evaluate depressive episodes lasting for longer than two months after a loss."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"For very severe depression that isn’t responding to medication, electroconvulsive therapy may be considered."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Most late-life cases of depression are treated with antidepressants that affect the brain’s chemistry to control moods. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most widely prescribed type of antidepressant."</p>
<a href="http://www.psychguides.com/guides/mood-disorder-symptoms-causes-and-effect/">Mood Disorder Symptoms, Causes and Effect</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Depression is typically treated with antidepressant medications. Antidepressants work to restore neurotransmitters. The specifically targeted neurotransmitters are serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine."</p>
<a href="http://www.psychguides.com/guides/schizophrenia/">Schizophrenia</a>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If you have schizophrenia, you should know that the course of this brain disease varies greatly. Medication can often control your symptoms. If you take your medication exactly as directed, you will likely have a mild type of the disease."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The symptoms of schizophrenia can be controlled in most people as long as they take their medications. After the first episode, doctors recommend that patients stay on medication for 12 to 24 months before reducing the dose. Patients who have had more than one episode or those who have not fully recovered may need to be treated for a longer period of time, and some people may need treatment indefinitely."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"People can also develop tardive dyskinesia when they take antipsychotics for a long period of time. This results in the uncontrolled movement of the mouth. If this develops, simply switching the type of antipsychotic can help."</p>
All of PsychGuides' articles that I looked at had the same 24/7 toll-free helpline number and the tag:  Provided by: Elements Behavioral Health.

So what started out as a nice cozy email from Laura inviting me to use a piece she had written on postpartum depression, turns out, with just a minimum of searching, to be a well-orchestrated publicity campaign by a multi-million dollar treatment consortium promoting – believe it or not<strong> – the very same inanely simplistic chemical imbalance theory that Ronald Pies, MD, assures us, is rejected by all well-informed psychiatrists.</strong>  Without much searching, I have found PsychGuides articles by Laura Chapman on ten different sites.

Needless to say, I won't be using Laura's article as a resource on my website.
