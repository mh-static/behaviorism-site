I've recently come across (courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/TallaTrialogue">Tallaght Trialogue</a>) an article in <i>Current Psychiatry</i> (Feb 2013) on this topic.  The author is Henry A. Nasrallah, M.D., and you can see it <a href="http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/article_pages.asp?aid=11050">here</a>.

Dr. Nasrallah, who is Editor-in-Chief of <i>Current Psychiatry</i>, states that there are 273 bio-markers for schizophrenia.  But wait.  Dr. Nasrallah goes on to say:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"None of the individual 273 biomarkers alone can serve as a diagnostic tool for the schizophrenias because there will be high rates of false positives and false negatives."</p>
One of the reasons for this, according to Dr. Nasrallah, is that schizophrenia is not a single condition.  There are "many schizophrenias."

He continues:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The complex heterogeneity of most psychiatric syndromes means that biomarkers will help unravel the rich neurobiology of those disorders and help elucidate the multiple neurobiologic underpinnings of these syndromes."</p>
Of course he's correct, with regards to the heterogeneity, but he clearly conceptualizes this not as the variations intrinsic to human existence, but rather as a multiplicity of brain diseases!

Note what's happened.  For decades the neurobiology of schizophrenia (and other "mental illnesses") has been psychiatry's holy grail.  Now, as it's <strong>becoming increasingly clear that it doesn't exist</strong>,  we have a new quest – the neurobiology of <i>multiple</i> schizophrenias.  All the earlier attempts failed because – get this – they were looking for the wrong thing!  But now that they're getting it right, Dr. Nasrallah tells us that it's happy times ahead.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Psychiatrists should look forward with great optimism to a bright future for psychiatric diagnosis, combining a set of clinical signs and symptoms with a confirmatory cluster of lab tests. It may take time, but psychiatric clinicians will be using biomarkers in the future and the media and the public finally will perceive psychiatry as a “mature” medical discipline."</p>
Dr. Nasrallah describes a survey he did of psychiatric practitioners.  Reportedly "…60.5% of responders predicted that the DSM-6 (approximately a decade from now) will contain laboratory tests for psychiatric diagnosis."

So just hang in there for another decade, and psychiatry will be a mature medical discipline.  Perhaps in the meantime there should be a sign outside every psychiatrist's office that says:  "Psychiatry is NOT a mature medical discipline"

Incidentally, according to <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;term=Nasrallah&amp;state%5Bid%5D=&amp;services%5B%5D=&amp;period%5B%5D=">ProPublica (Dollars for Docs)</a>, Dr. Nasrallah received<strong> $897,079 from various pharmaceutical companies between 2009 and 2012</strong>.

Also incidentally, here are the names of other members of <i>Current Psychiatry's</i> editorial staff who received money from pharmaceutical companies in the same period.  (Also per <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/">ProPublica</a>.)
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">$169,324      Joseph Goldberg MD, Deputy Editor, 2009-12
$17,303        Robert A. Kowatch MD, PhD, Section Editor, 2010
$80,178        George Grossberg MD, Section Editor, 2010-12
$298,738      Sheldon Preskorn MD, PhD, Section Editor, 2009-12
$401,278      Robert Anthenelli MD, Section Editor, 2009-12
$46,423        Dale D'Mello,MD, Dept. Editor, 2010-11
$394,376      Leslie Lundt MD, Dept. Editor, 2009-12
$134,037      Robert McCarron DO, Section Editor, 2009-12</p>
Of course it is entirely possible that all of this pharmaceutical money has no effect whatsoever on the content of the journal.  <i>Current Psychiatry</i> also has 16 editorial consultants, five of whom have taken pharmaceutical money in recent years.(Also per <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/">ProPublica</a>.)
