It's widely known that Thomas Insel, MD, Director of NIMH, recently proclaimed that the DSM's diagnostic categories are invalid, and that this agency would no longer use these categories as the basis for research.  But he went on to reaffirm his agency's <strong>commitment to a biological model</strong> of "mental illness" and to <strong>funding research into biological causes</strong> of these problems.  He has since issued a joint statement with Jeffrey Lieberman, President Elect of APA, which makes it clear that they're still the best of friends, but he didn't really recant his earlier statement.
