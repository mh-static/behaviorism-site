I have recently learned of a new website:  <a href="http://www.auntiepsychiatry.com/AuntiePsychiatry/">www.auntiepsychiatry.com</a>.  The posts consist of cartoons drawn by Auntie Psychiatry, and the site is well worth a visit.  Auntie hopes to publish a new cartoon each week.

I have long felt that we need to diversity in the methods we use to spread our message, and cartoons seem a nice choice.  One drawing is worth a thousand words!
