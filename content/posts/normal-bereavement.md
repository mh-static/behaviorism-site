There was a nice article in the <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960248-7/fulltext">Lancet</a> last month.  The article posed the question: “When should grief be classified as a mental illness?”

The author criticized the APA’s draft version of DSM-5 for blurring the distinction and for making it more likely that people in bereavement will be “diagnosed” as depressed and, of course, “treated” with prescription drugs.

There has been a good deal of criticism against the APA on this issue, and it is likely that the final version of DSM-5 will reflect some retreat in this matter.

The problem is not new, however.  DSM-III included “uncomplicated bereavement” (V62-82) as a V code (i.e. “conditions not attributable to a mental disorder.”)  V62-82 occurs also in DSM-IV, but without the word “uncomplicated.”  What is noteworthy, however, is that in DSM-IV, a list is provided of “symptoms” that can be used to distinguish a normal bereavement from major depression.  The APA’s agenda is clear and has always been clear:  to pathologize for their own profit, and for the profit of pharmaceutical companies, as much of human existence as possible.  There is clear and steady progression in this regard from DSM-III to DSM-IV and now to the draft DSM-5.

There are no mental disorders.  There are people with problems, one of which is the loss of loved ones.  These human problems are not helped by drug-taking.  Bereavement in particular should not be addressed in this way.  Attempts to smother the feelings of loss and despondency with chemicals are always counter-productive.
