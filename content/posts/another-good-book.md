<em>Taking America Off Drugs</em> by Stephen Ray Flora

A few weeks ago,<a href="https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2011/12/28/forensic-psychiatry/#.Txzc-W8V3a8"> in a comment</a>, A Behaviorist Fan recommended the above book to me.  It came out in 2007, and I don’t know how I missed it at the time.  But I’ve read it now and it’s a superb piece of work.

Definitely a <em>must buy</em> and must keep close at hand.  Stephen analyses the various “diagnoses” listed in DSM.  He points out their behavioral nature, and describes how they can be ameliorated with relatively simple behavioral techniques.

Buy it; read it; read it again; and tell your friends.
