On August 22, thanks to the generosity of an anonymous deceased donor and his bereaved family, I received a kidney transplant.  The surgery was successful, and the kidney is working very well.

I have to take immunosuppressants, of course, and I am having some difficulty adjusting to these.  I am still very tired, and but generally my condition is improving.

I hope to be “back on the air” soon.

Best wishes
