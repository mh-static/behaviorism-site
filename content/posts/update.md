Sorry I've been "off the air."  My wife, Nancy, fell and broke her thigh bone a couple of weeks ago.  She is out of the hospital and recuperating well, but my days are filled with the minutiae of personal care and domestic management.

Stay tuned.  I still have lots to say concerning the spurious nature of DSM's so-called mental illnesses.
