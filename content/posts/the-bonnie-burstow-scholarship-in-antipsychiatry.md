Bonnie Burstow, PhD, is a faculty member at the University of Toronto, and an antipsychiatry activist.  She writes about topics that include institutional ruling, resistance, and social change.

On October 7, 2016, the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) at the University of Toronto announced that they had established a scholarship for students doing theses in the area of antipsychiatry.

The scholarship committee has issued a <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2016/10/bonnie-burstow-scholarship-antipsychiatry-campaign-launched/">statement</a> providing details, and requesting donations.  Please take a look, and pass the link on to others who might have an interest.

The establishment of an antipsychiatry scholarship at a prestigious, mainstream university takes our movement to a new level of acceptance and recognition.

Dr. Burstow is also the author of <em>Psychiatry and the Business of Madness</em> (2015).
