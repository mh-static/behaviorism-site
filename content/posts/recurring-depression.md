Now I am having the same problem with the Paxil, and I really just want to get off the medication all together because I feel that it is causing the depression.  I was never depressed to begin with, but now I am!  After a couple of bad experiences with withdrawal symptoms from coming off the meds, I am really apprehensive about trying to taper off of them, but I want myself back, not this medicated, lethargic, irritable, unproductive person.  I was far from perfect, as my ex-husband made painfully clear, but I always had hope for a better future and energy to work for it.  I can't help but feel that the meds have done more harm than good in my particular situation.  I just wonder if others have had similar experiences?  Thank you and best wishes in whatever you are searching for...
