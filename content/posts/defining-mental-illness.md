There's a take-no-prisoners article by Paula Caplan on Psychology Today.  You can see Paula's article <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/science-isnt-golden/201303/how-the-ny-times-portrays-psychiatric-diagnosis">here</a>.  (Thanks to @yobluemama2 on Twitter for the link.)

Here are some quotes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"…the now well-established facts that psychiatric diagnosis is unscientific, does not reduce human suffering, and causes many kinds of serious harm."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"…the chances even that two therapists simultaneously meeting with the same person will assign that person the same label are poor, which of course means that diagnosis is not helpful in choosing treatment or improving outcome."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"'The potential damage caused by a diagnosis is virtually limitless, including loss of custody of a child, loss of employment, skyrocketing insurance premiums, and loss of the right to make decisions about one's medical and legal affairs'."</em></p>
Paula is a psychologist who served on two DSM-IV committees but resigned in protest against the<strong> poor quality of the "science" </strong>that was being used to create "diagnoses."<strong> </strong> For this reason she has some <strong>unique insights into the DSM compilation process</strong>.  Her articles are always worth reading.
