This morning, I received, by way of a forward from MIA, the following from Dr. Pies.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</strong></p>
&nbsp;

I have read Dr. Philip Hickey’s 8400+ word treatise, and I have only the following to say with regard to the two key points at issue:
<ol>
	<li>1. Notwithstanding my omission of quotation marks in my original Medscape article [1]—for which I take responsibility—the fact remains: I have never believed or argued that the so-called chemical imbalance theory (which was never really a theory) is merely a “little white lie.” It is that point of view—not merely typed words on the page—that has been falsely and carelessly attributed to me.</li>
	<li>2. I have never received a dime from any pharmaceutical company or private agency with any verbal or written understanding that I would “promote” (elevate, popularize, hype, etc.) a particular drug. If any of the papers I wrote or co-authored over a decade ago had the effect of putting a drug in a favorable light, it was because the best scientific evidence available at that time supported the drug’s benefit. Nothing in Philip Hickey’s belaboring of half-truths, innuendos and guilt by association demonstrates otherwise.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

Sincerely,

Ronald Pies MD
