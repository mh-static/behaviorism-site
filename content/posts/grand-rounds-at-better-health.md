Dr. Val Jones has this week's Grand Rounds up at <a href="http://getbetterhealth.com/grand-rounds-volume-7-number-26-the-emotional-edition/2011.03.22">Better Health</a>.   You can find reading material here for the entire week, as Dr. Jones has included more than forty posts.  Some are inspirational, like Dr. Ed Pullen's <a href="http://drpullen.com/carpediem/">Carpe Diem</a>; others cover material that is hard to believe, as in Roy's post <a href="http://psychiatrist-blog.blogspot.com/2011/03/doctors-to-go-to-jail-for-asking.html">Doctors to Go to Jail for Asking Patients about Guns in the Home</a>.   Whatever your fields of interest, there will something for you.  Take a look.
