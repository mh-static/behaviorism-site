There's a very interesting article by Paris Williams on Mad in America, <i>The "Mental Illness" Paradigm: An "Illness" That is out of Control.</i>  You can see it <a href="http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/05/the-mental-illness-paradigm-itself-an-illness-that-is-out-of-control/">here</a>.

It's an excellent article.  Please take a look.
