This week's Grand Rounds is hosted by David Williams at <a href="http://www.healthbusinessblog.com/2011/11/grand-rounds-meaningful-use-of-aco-edition/">Health Business Blog</a>.   As usual, there is plenty of good reading.  Pranab's post <a href="http://scepticemia.com/2011/10/31/trick-or-treatment-do-doctors-encourage-poor-patient-behaviors/">Trick or Treat: Do Doctors Encourage Poor Patient Behaviors</a>, at the blog <a href="http://scepticemia.com/">Scepticemia</a> is well-written, interesting, and says as much about behavior as it does about medicine.
