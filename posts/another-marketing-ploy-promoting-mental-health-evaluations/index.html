<p>The gist of the article, which is written for the general public, is that when you go in to your doctor for a check-up, you should ask for a mental evaluation as well.  The article reminds us that &ldquo;25% of American adults suffer from some form of mental illness each year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are also informed that many people &ldquo;attempt to cope&rdquo; with these illnesses for an average of 10 years.  This factoid is attributed to an organization called <a href="http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/">Mental Health America</a>.</p>

I tried to track down the "new study from the University of Cambridge," but without success.  The Great Google, however, did point out that the <strong>exact same phrase occurred in another article</strong> – this one by Rick Nauert, PhD, Senior News Editor for PsychCentral.   It's called:  <a href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/02/18/mental-health-checkups-as-important-as-annual-physicals/51727.html"><em>Mental Health Checkups as Important as Annual Physicals.</em></a>"  Dr. Nauert provides a little more information on the "new study."  He intimates (without actually stating) that it was written by Barbara Sahakian, "a leading UK neuroscientist."  Dr. Sahakian is quoted as saying:
