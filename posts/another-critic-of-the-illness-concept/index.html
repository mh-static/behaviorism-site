<meta name="description" content="I&rsquo;ve recently come across another DSM critic – or as Dr. Novella terms us – a mental illness denier.
His name is Peter Kinderman, and he is head of the Institute of Psychology, Health and Society at the University of Liverpool.  He has recently written an article called &quot;Grief and anxiety are not mental illnesses.&quot;
Here are some quotes:
&#34;For a few of us, our experiences of abuse or failure lead us to feel that life is not worth living. We need to recognise these human truths and we need to offer help. But we should not regard these human experiences as symptoms of a mental illness.&#34;">
