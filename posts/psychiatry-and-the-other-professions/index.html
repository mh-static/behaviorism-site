Some of the \"ancillary\" professionals embrace this conceptual framework happily, even enthusiastically. Others do not. During my working career I was, as you might imagine, in the latter group. I dealt with the conflicts by addressing them as best I could and helping my clients to the best of my ability. But the fact is that the spurious and destructive medical model constituted a truly dreadful work environment. DISAGREEING WITH PSYCHIATRY\nOver the years I discussed this issue with colleagues, but I don’t think I had ever seen the matter addressed in print until I recently came across an article by Lucy Johnstone, PhD. It’s called \"Twenty-Five Years of Disagreeing with Psychiatry.\" It’s a chapter in the book Mental Health Still Matters, eds. J Reynolds, R Muston, J Leach, M McCormack, J Wallcraft, M Walsh. Open University Press, 2009.\nThe article is noteworthy on two counts. Firstly, for its content; and secondly that it got written at all. The tyrannous nature of the medical model is seldom articulated.

Since medication is constantly being adjusted, any change for the better is bound to coincide with a new dosage and can be attributed to it.\"\n\"Belief in medical interventions is also maintained by disqualifying the counter-evidence.\"\n\"The idea that one might not subscribe to this kind of thought-system at all is incomprehensible to many.\"\n\"…dissenters from the orthodoxy are told not only that they are wrong, but that such views should not be held or expressed at all. The credibility of psychiatry has to be maintained by an appearance of consensus, and cracks in the façade can arouse a deeply defensive and threatened response.\"\nIn very recent years, the anti-psychiatry movement, which continues to gain momentum, has perhaps made it easier for members of the other professions to \"come out.\" But economics makes cowards of us all, and we need to begin creating an environment where a social worker, for instance, can feel free to challenge in a staff meeting the prescribing of drugs for a particular individual; or where a counselor can express the belief that a client's problem is loneliness rather than a brain illness.
