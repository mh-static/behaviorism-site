<p>This week I&rsquo;ve come across interesting responses from two different psychiatrists.</p>
<p>First, Adrian Preda, MD, from California.  <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f191?tab=responses">Dr. Preda apparently attributes</a> at least some of the anti-psychiatry groundswell to the ignorance of the general public and the bias of the media, whom he contrasts to the well-informed experts who understand the nuances.  The article is brief and vague, but by <i>experts</i> I think he means psychiatrists!</p>
<p>It reminds me of the old joke:</p>
<p>Q:  What&rsquo;s the difference between a psychiatrist and God?</p>
<p>A:  God doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>The second (and completely contrasting) reaction is from <a href="http://www.mountainx.com/article/48225/Rethinking-mental-health-Local-practitioners-groups-reject-mainstream-treatment">Daniel Johnson</a>, a psychiatrist from Ashville, North Carolina.  Dr. Johnson reportedly saw the light after reading an article by Dr. Marcia Angell.  He has also worked with Dr. Peter Breggin.  He decided to start <i>listening </i>to his clients rather than trying to fit them into &ldquo;diagnostic&rdquo; cubby holes.  There&rsquo;s an idea!</p>
