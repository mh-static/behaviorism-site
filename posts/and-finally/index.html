<p>The war against psychiatry – and I make no apologies for describing it in such terms – needs to be fought on three main fronts.  Firstly, we need to promote tried and true methods of dealing with distress that do not entail spurious medicalization, damaging &ldquo;treatments&rdquo;, and routine disempowerment of individuals who seek help.  Secondly, we need to continue vigorous critiquing of the psychiatric hoax wherever and whenever it surfaces.  When we ignore these spurious and pernicious accounts, we do a grave disservice to those countless individuals who have been victimized by the hoax, and who find validation in our protests.  And these are the people who will finally bury psychiatry in the morass of its own inane, arrogant, self-righteous disease-mongering.  Thirdly, we need to use every opportunity to educate various stakeholders, especially government officials – local, state, and federal – concerning psychiatry&rsquo;s spurious medicalization of virtually every problem of thinking, feeling, and behaving.</p>
