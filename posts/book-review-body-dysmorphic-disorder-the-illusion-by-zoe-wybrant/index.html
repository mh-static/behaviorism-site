<title>Book Review:  Body Dysmorphic Disorder:  The Illusion,  by Zoe Wybrant | Behaviorism and Mental Health</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="Body Dysmorphic Disorder is one of the so-called mental disorders listed in the DSM-5.  The manual lists the following  diagnostic criteria, (p 242):
A.  Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others.
B.  At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others ) in response to the appearance concerns.
C.  The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
D.  The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder.

Body Dysmorphic Disorder:  The Illusion, discusses this &#34;disorder&#34; from the perspective of someone who has struggled with these issues herself.  Zoe challenges the usefulness of diagnosis and standard psychiatric treatment – and provides an abundance of clearly-stated contributory factors, together with suggestions for self-help.
The book reads nicely, and would be helpful for anyone who is troubled with these kinds of concerns, or for therapists/counselors who encounter these kinds of issues in their work.  Here are some quotes:">

<em><strong>Body Dysmorphic Disorder:  The Illusion</strong></em>, discusses this "disorder" from the perspective of someone who has struggled with these issues herself.  Zoe challenges the usefulness of diagnosis and standard psychiatric treatment – and provides an abundance of clearly-stated contributory factors, together with suggestions for self-help.
<p>The book reads nicely, and would be helpful for anyone who is troubled with these kinds of concerns, or for therapists/counselors who encounter these kinds of issues in their work.  Here are some quotes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"A child who is <em>never</em> encouraged nor praised, nor shown affection, may harbour feelings of insecurity and low self-worth, because when we are rejected, we wonder why."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If we have tooth-ache pain-relief does not remove our pain, it numbs it, temporarily.  We must address the cause of the tooth-ache to solve the problem.  The same applies to anxiety."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Being diagnosed as mentally ill leads us to believe our problem is out of our hands.  The key to beating anxiety is taking control, how can we do this if we believe we have none?"</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"I wonder if you have ever encountered a questionnaire that has asked if there is a 'history of depression' in your family?  If you answer yes, the problem can be interpreted as genetic, but most people at some point encounter depression.  Our mother may have experienced depression as the result of a divorce, and our grandmother having lost a child.  Unfortunately when 'family history of depression' is recorded, it suggests depression is part of our genetic make-up.  One of my own assessments read to this effect, it's terribly misleading."</p>

One of the great evils of psychiatry is the fact that its spurious medicalization of all human problems is fundamentally disempowering.  The message, endlessly repeated in adverts, infomercials, and psychiatric opinion pieces, is that human problems are illnesses which need to be "treated" by medical experts, usually through toxic drugs, which they euphemistically describe as medications.  Psychiatry has eroded, and in some areas, virtually eliminated, the notion that people can help themselves overcome counterproductive perceptions, mindsets, and behaviors.  <strong>The Illusion</strong> offers a refreshing and much-needed counterpoint to this perspective.
