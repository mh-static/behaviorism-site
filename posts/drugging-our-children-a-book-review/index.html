Duncan \"When the evidence is explored, no reasonable scientist or practitioner would come down on the side of a favorable risk/benefit profile for pediatric use of antipsychotics.\" [p 87]\n6. Legal Issues Surrounding the Psychiatric Drugging of Children and Youth, by Jim Gottstein \"The horrific use of neuroleptics on defenseless children and youth cries out for legal efforts to curtail the practice.\" [p 115]\n7. Drug-Free Mental Health Care for Children and Youth: Lessons from Residential Treatment, by Tony Stanton \"One of the first things we observed in the records sent to us was a death of curiosity. This was due, in part, to the rush to impose a diagnostic label. Once the diagnosis was applied, curiosity was no longer necessary. The goal had been reached: the child's behaviors and symptoms were placed in their proper category. In the records sent to us, we saw the repeated implication that there was nothing left to describe or discover. In particular, the child's living connections with caretakers and their history had become irrelevant. A logical result was that clues about the origins of symptoms like those we found for Mark or Jim, didn't need to be pursued.\" [ p 129]\n8. Strategic Family Therapy as an Alternative to Antipsychotics, by George Stone \"Psychiatry assumes that a child's psychological issues are biological events that have no meaning and sweeps the important social and contextual information that is being conveyed under the rug of genetic malfunction.\" [ p 147]\n9. How Parents Can Improve Their Children's Developmental Trajectories, by Adena B. Meyers and Laura E. Berk \"Little attention is paid to the many risk and protective factors that may influence children's trajectories over time. Instead, there is a tendency to reify diagnostic labels while losing sight of their hypothetical nature. This may create the erroneous impression that a tangible disease entity with known causes, processes, and treatment mechanisms permanently resides within each affected child.\" [p 154]\n10. Building Healthy Minds: It Takes a Village, by Stuart Shanker \"In order for primary care physicians to play the central role that I have outlined, they will need to make a major modality shift, away from treating symptoms with psychiatric drugs to addressing the causes.\" [ p 183]\nAfterword, by Sharna Olfman \"Record levels of psychiatric disturbance, violence, poverty, apathy, and despair among our children speak to our current cultural crisis.\" [p 187]\nThis is a well-written and compelling book. It describes, in detail, psychiatry's shameful, destructive, and widespread drugging of our children. But it also offers a conceptual framework and practical suggestions for breaking free from the psychiatric-pharma destruction. I highly recommend this book for parents, mental health workers, and anyone who has an interest in the welfare of our children.\n",
