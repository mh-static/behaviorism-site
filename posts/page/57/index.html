  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Christopher Lane has a post up on Psychology Today (May 14 2012) called: DSM-5 Is Diagnosed, With a Stinging Rebuke to the APA.
About a year ago, the APA announced the new “diagnoses” that they proposed to include in the upcoming DSM-5. This kind of expansion is nothing new. The APA has been engaged in the medicalization of every conceivable human problem for the past 50 or 60 years.
But on this occasion, some of their more creative and potentially damaging creations generated a good deal of fairly vocal opposition. The upshot of this is a decision by the APA to drop two of the more contentious “diagnoses:” - “attenuated psychosis syndrome” and “mixed anxiety and depression.”

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Yahoo News recently ran an Associated Press article with the above heading. Here are some quotes:
Disturbing new research says the number of U.S. babies born with signs of opiate drug withdrawal has tripled in a decade because of a surge in pregnant women&#39;s use of legal and illegal narcotics, including Vicodin, OxyContin and heroin, researchers say.
The number of newborns with withdrawal symptoms increased from a little more than 1 per 1,000 babies sent home from the hospital in 2000 to more than 3 per 1,000 in 2009, the study found. More than 13,000 U.S. infants were affected in 2009, the researchers estimated.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Too Much Sex?
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Christopher Lane recently published an interesting article on Psychology Today.
The article covers a number of topics, including the APA’s proposal to include “hypersexual disorder” in the upcoming DSM-5. The implications of this proposed “diagnosis” are that if you think about sex too much or engage in sexual activity too much, then you have a mental illness.
Back in the 60’s, when I was at college, I would frequently find myself chatting with a group of fellow students on a wide range of topics, including sex. Often someone would cite the old statistic that the average young adult male thinks about sex 171 times a day (or whatever), to which the chorus of replies was always – “no way; it’s much more often than that.”

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>About a week ago an article appeared on the ‘net concerning an attempt by parents to ban ice cream vendors from a playground in Brooklyn, New York. The piece was reprinted in the New York Post. Apparently some of the parents are upset because the arrival of the vendors stimulates requests for ice cream from the children, which results in confrontation and bitterness.
Responsible parents everywhere will recognize the dilemma. Ice cream has little or no nutritional value, but children like it. So do we stand our ground or do we give in?

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The central theme of this blog is that the APA’s so-called diagnostic system is spurious and destructive. It is destructive of the individuals that get caught in its net and destructive socially in that it undermines those values of resourcefulness and efficacy which are essential ingredients of a successful society.
Psychiatrists have become tawdry drug pushers. To this end they have prostituted their medical affiliations and have avidly promoted the big lie: that ordinary human problems are in fact illnesses best “treated” by drugs.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Recently I was listening to NPR on the car radio. The program was about so-called obsessive compulsive disorder, and a woman was describing her difficulty in this area. I didn’t record her actual words, but it went something like this:
I have all these checks and rituals that I have to do each day. And it’s beginning to put a strain on my marriage. Sometimes my husband wants to go somewhere but I can’t go until I finish my checks.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Yesterday I received the following email from a reader.
“What’s your stance on eccentricity? How do you relate to the general view in the APA that deviation from cultural norms is pathological? And, have you ever read about David Weeks?
I consider myself an eccentric person with many quirks and some fetishes. While I have many friends who share the same interests or many of them, I still feel a little bad about psychiatrists labeling eccentricity with SPD or Schizoid personality disorder. I am 19, and my friends are from the 18-25 years of age, and we share a common love for anime and cartoons. Maybe not always the same but sometimes we share two or more common cartoons. Some of them also are collectors of stuffed animals and figurines like me, and some of them engage in masturbation with those objects as me.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There was a nice article in the Lancet last month. The article posed the question: “When should grief be classified as a mental illness?”
The author criticized the APA’s draft version of DSM-5 for blurring the distinction and for making it more likely that people in bereavement will be “diagnosed” as depressed and, of course, “treated” with prescription drugs.
There has been a good deal of criticism against the APA on this issue, and it is likely that the final version of DSM-5 will reflect some retreat in this matter.

    <p>In 1997 I worked part-time for a nursing home. This facility had an open-door policy and had a reputation in the state for being able to accommodate even the most difficult and unmanageable clients.
Some of this reputation was attributable to their generous administration of major tranquilizers, but in addition there was a high level of acceptance and compassion among the staff, and there is no doubt in my mind that this was a major factor in their success.
