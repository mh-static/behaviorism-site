    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>INTRODUCTION
I have recently read an interesting paper titled: Liberating People From Psychiatric Diagnoses: Exploring Severe Mental, Behavioral, and Emotional Disturbances Through Biographic Documentaries. The author is Stephen Wong, PhD, Emeritus Associate Professor, Florida International University. The piece was published in Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry, Volume 23, Number 2, 2021. Here are some quotes from the paper, interspersed with my thoughts and comments.
Here’s the abstract:
&#34;This article posits that the DSM-5 and its psychiatric diagnoses are a monumental artifact of social power rather than a useful system for naming, describing, classifying, or understanding mental disorders. Two biographic documentaries, &#39;Crumb&#39; and &#39;Jupiter’s Wife&#39;, are examined as alternative information about people with severe mental, behavioral, and emotional disturbances, which ordinarily would be diagnosed as schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder. In contrast to the disease processes implied by psychiatric diagnoses, these detailed documentaries revealed particular social (e.g., lack of positive role models, bullying), environmental (e.g., poverty, homelessness), and historical (e.g., child abuse, failure in school) factors that might have brought about the individual’s personal problems. Seeing people in the actual places where they live and hearing about their struggles first-hand can evoke sympathy and empathy in viewers, potentially freeing them from the technical abstractions and pathological attributions inherent in psychiatric diagnoses.&#34;

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>INTRODUCTION
I have recently read:
‘The Explanation You Have Been Looking For’: Neurobiology as Promise and Hermeneutic Closure
The piece was written by Joseph E. Davis, PhD, Research Professor of the Institute of Advanced Studies in Culture, University of Virginia. It was published online by Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry on the 5th of August, 2021. ABSTRACT
Here’s the paper’s abstract, quoted in full:
&#34;The biomedical aspiration of psychiatry has fundamentally reoriented clinical practice since the DSM-III in 1980 and reverberated in the public sphere. Over time, lay public understanding of the causes of mental suffering has increasingly endorsed biological conceptions. In this paper, I explore the sources from which a neurobiological model for mental suffering reaches ordinary people, and investigate its rhetorical appeal, personal appropriation, and consequences. Drawing on interviews and other data, I show that these sources—physicians, popular media, and advertising—share common ontological and moral assumptions. These assumptions, in turn, influence how people take up neurobiological explanation to account for their suffering, and how, paradoxically, they join it to their projects of self-determination. I conclude by considering how, from a phenomenological perspective, a neurobiological account fails to enhance self-knowledge or determination but leads to a hermeneutic dead end.&#34;

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>INTRODUCTION
Since about the mid 1960’s, the great majority of psychiatrists have abandoned any form of psychosocial perspective, and have insisted that the various items listed in successive revisions of the DSM are “real illnesses”. The usual justification for this is based on the assertion that the “symptoms” of these items are caused by neurological malfunctions (e.g., chemical imbalances, neural circuitry aberrations, etc.). Although there is no evidence to support these claims, psychiatrists continue to promote them. I have written about these promotions (e.g., here, here, here, and here). Many other anti-psychiatry writers have also criticized these simplistic, unproven theories.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
by Michael Coughlin
I survived the tragic and sudden death of my 12-year-old brother, the near-death of my second brother, and the horrific suicide of my uncle, all with barely any medication. I became an extremely happy and high-functioning adult through holistic and spiritual growth. I loved life itself.
Then a freak occurrence happened. I got a pinched nerve in my neck that caused anxiety, and my doctor prescribed Paxil, a dangerous antidepressant, without any screening, a formal diagnosis, or any fair warning of the risks or explanation of how long I would need to take the drug for. I was always against antidepressants because I studied them in college and I knew they were often overprescribed, and I let my guard down for just one day. After just two days of the drug, I couldn’t fall asleep naturally for weeks, something that never occurred in my entire life before. I developed hypomanic symptoms, sleeping only a few hours a night for three weeks, and my doctor was nowhere to be found to help. He remained in denial. The BU Center for Anxiety &amp; Related Disorders discharged me when I was in need of help. The McLean Mental Hospital didn’t return my phone calls. I would later learn that I was suffering from Antidepressant-Associated Hypomania and no one could get me the care that I needed.

INTRODUCTION One of the problems in the present debate about neurochemical imbalances is that almost every word in the English language has at least two meanings, and sometimes four or five. Some English speakers deplore this state of affairs and regard it as an endless source of confusion. Others consider it an indication of the richness of the language and its ability to express finely tuned nuances. Others use it as a tool of obfuscation.
