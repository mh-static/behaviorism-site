    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>On October 28, Allen Frances, MD, Chairperson of the DSM-IV task force, published an article on Psychology Today. It is titled Does It Make Sense To Scrap Psychiatric Diagnosis? and is essentially a response to the British Psychological Society’s Division of Clinical Psychology’s (DCP) call to abandon the medical model in situations where it is not appropriate, and to embrace a psychosocial approach. You can see a copy of the DCP’s May 13, 2013, statement here.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>THE CAFÉ study was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in July 2007, and was funded by AstraZeneca. Its stated purpose was to compare AstraZeneca’s drug Seroquel (quetiapine) with other neuroleptic products. I have discussed the CAFÉ study here.
Two of CAFÉ’s participants committed suicide during the study period. Both had been randomly assigned to the quetiapine treatment. There are very strong indications that one of these individuals – Dan Markingson, who was enrolled in the study at the University of Minnesota site – was coerced into the study and, because of his psychotic state, was incapable of giving informed consent anyway. He was not doing well on the Seroquel, and his mother, Mary Weiss, made repeated attempts to have him withdrawn from the study and taken off the drug, but without success. In particular, Mary had expressed the belief that Dan was in danger of killing himself. AstraZeneca paid the University of Minnesota $15,648 for each study participant who completed the treatment course.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">A Psychiatric Case Study.  A Sad Story
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the criticisms that I routinely make of psychiatry is that its primary agenda during initial evaluations is the assignment of a “diagnosis,” and that ongoing “treatment” consists of 15-minute “med checks,” during which drug regimens are changed and adjusted. The essence of my criticism is that this kind of approach inevitably oversimplifies human problems, and in practice does more harm than good.
My contentions in this regard have from time to time been challenged. It has been said that my portrayal of psychiatry is a kind of misleading caricature, and that in reality, psychiatrists do, in fact, concern themselves with human issues over and above “diagnosis” and drugs. This debate will, of course, continue, but I recently read an article on Psychiatric Times that has some bearing on the matter. [Thanks to Nick Stuart for the link.] The title is Conduct Disorder, ADHD – or Something Else Altogether? The author is Steven Dilsaver, MD, and the piece is dated October 11, 2013. The article is a case study of the psychiatric “treatment” of an eight-year-old boy (John).

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There’s an interesting article by Christopher Lane, PhD, in his blog site Side Effects, on Psychology Today. It’s called Crazy like Us: How the U.S. Exports Its Models of Illness, and is dated October 9. Christopher Lane is the author of Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness. I wrote a post in April of 2010 that referenced this book.
Here’s the opening paragraph from the Psychology Today article.
&#34;The fears of many European psychiatrists may soon be realized. Earlier this week, Psychiatric News reported that the American Psychiatric Association has begun petitioning the various agencies overseeing changes to the ICD, or International Classification of Diseases, to request that they adopt its most-controversial changes in DSM-5.&#34;

    <p>On Monday, October 7, 2013, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper ran the following headline: 1,200 Killed By Mental Patients. Shock 10-year toll exposes care crisis. It took up almost all of the front page.
The headline precipitated a great deal of protest from politicians, advocacy groups, mental health professionals, and others. The general points in most of these protests were that the headline was sensationalistic, misleading, and would serve to increase the stigma associated with “mental illness.”

    <p>I recently came across an APA article titled Change, Challenge, and Opportunity: Psychiatry in the Age of Health Care Reform. It was co-authored by Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, and Howard Goldman, MD, PhD, and dated October 3.
The article discusses the implications of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for psychiatry, and also reviews progress of the 2008 Mental Health Parity Act. The latter mandated that insurance coverage for “mental illnesses” be essentially on a par with coverage for general medical problems, but the act has not yet been implemented in its entirety. The authors also point out that there are provisions in the ACA that focus on reform of the actual health care services, as well as the reform of health care insurance.
