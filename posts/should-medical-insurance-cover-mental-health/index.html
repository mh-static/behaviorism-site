<p>The article describes the kinds of conflicts that can occur between people with &ldquo;mental illnesses&rdquo; wanting &ldquo;treatment,&rdquo; and insurance companies who sometimes are reluctant to pay for this &ldquo;treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The article is fairly balanced.  It presents a number of actual cases of people who were experiencing difficulty.  But it also tries to do justice to the insurance company&rsquo;s position:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The insurance executives say that the medical benefits of such treatments are not clear and that the industry is essentially being asked to write a blank check."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"…there is often little accepted medical evidence to support the range of treatments for many mental illnesses, like schizophrenia and severe depression."</p>
The impact of the 2008 Mental Health Parity Act and the Affordable Care Act are discussed, and it is also reported that a number of lawsuits on these matters are pending.
<p>My position on this issue is clear.  The problems of thinking, feeling and behaving, collectively known as &ldquo;mental illnesses&rdquo; or &ldquo;mental disorders,&rdquo; <strong>are <i>not</i> illnesses in any meaningful sense of the term</strong>.  They are not medical matters, and therefore their &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; should <i>not </i>be covered by health insurance plans.</p>

<p>The fight for parity is routinely presented as a struggle for justice and against discrimination.  It is actually a <strong>struggle for further expansion of psycho-pharma activity</strong>.</p>
