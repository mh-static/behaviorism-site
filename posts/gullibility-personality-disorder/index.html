<p>Apparently Paul Frampton, an eminent British physicist currently working at the University of North Carolina, established a relationship on an online dating site with a person whom he says he believed was Miss Bikini World 2007.  He flew to La Paz, Bolivia, to meet her.  Of course she wasn’t there, but a nice gentleman gave him “her” suitcase and asked if he’d be kind enough to take it to Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Customs officers at Buenos Aires became suspicious and discovered more than 4 pounds of cocaine inside a false lining in the suitcase.</p>
<p>So now the good professor is in jail, where he says the food is “inedible.”  He’s facing a possible 16 years of prison time.</p>
<p>The interesting thing from the point of view of this website is that as part of his defense his lawyers hired a forensic psychologist who has “diagnosed” the professor with, believe it or not, “gullibility personality disorder.”</p>
