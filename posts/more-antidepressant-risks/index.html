Me: No thank you. Nephrologist: But you are depressed. Me: Anyone in my circumstances who is not depressed hasn’t grasped the reality of his predicament. Nephrologist: But it would help you feel better. Me. I don’t want to talk about it any more.\nHe then turned to my wife, Nancy, who was in the room, and tried to enlist her aid in persuading me to take the drugs.\nNancy replied: Is there something about Phil’s response that you don’t understand?\nNothing further was said, but we heard later that about 80% of the patients in that unit were taking antidepressants. That’s 60 chairs, 3 shifts Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and 3 shifts Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday – about 360 patients x 80% = 288. For the record, I came through the down times using the time-honored methods of talking to family and the occasional good cry, and staying as busy as my condition permitted.\nIn another treatment unit, about a year later, I received similar pressure from a different nephrologist. I was an inpatient at the time, and he was so persistent that eventually I had to order him out of my room.\nIn fairness, it needs to be said that in the twelve years I’ve been sick, I’ve worked with about 20 different nephrologists, and these were the only two who subjected me to this kind of pressure. But although these drug pushers may be a minority, they have a disproportionate effect. Nephrologists tend to work in large practices because they have to provide 24/7 care. So over, say, a six month period, every doctor sees pretty much every patient. The drug pushers use this opportunity to prescribe the antidepressants, and the other doctors are generally reluctant to reverse this decision. So the prescriptions stay in place by inertia.\nOne of the realities of life is that sick people like to talk about their illnesses, and over the years I’ve met and swapped stories with hundreds of fellow sufferers – not only in nephrology, but in other specialties as well. One of the questions I usually ask is: did they want you to take antidepressants? And it is truly shocking how often the answer is yes.\nA major part of the rationale behind this drug pushing is that the antidepressants will help the body to heal generally. This has always seemed like pharma spiel to me, and the Auerbach study suggests, not only that the rationale is false, but that the opposite is more likely to be the case.\nIncidentally, there are no records of financial ties between any of the authors and pharma (Dollars for Docs).\n",
