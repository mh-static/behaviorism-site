I don&rsquo;t want to see him again. I don&rsquo;t want to have sex again. I&rsquo;ve been raped in another country, in that i was so freakin drunk that i was about to have sex on a bench, but ,managed to get up and wlak away and he let me. Now, I drink and i feel the need to cut myself. I feel so alone, so scared of this feeling inside me and so embarrassed. I thought i had overcome this in my depression \but my leg is cut up and my hands and i don&rsquo;t know where else to turn. I don&rsquo;t want help from &lsquo;professionals&rsquo;. I got drunk one time and threatened to kill myself.  I got beaten by the police and taken to the hospital. The next day i feel fine, and i know i should stop drinking, but I&rsquo;m 21 and I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL. It hurts me to know this is inside me and i hate it. The blood fades but the scars never do, and they&rsquo;re on show for everyone who looks. What then? How do i explain this to other people?  My shame, my skin, my depression? I do love my life and i always think that i make this great big progressions in my depression, yet here i am, cutting myself. Is it my subconscious telling me no i&rsquo;m not okay or is it my depression acting out against my own happiness. Every time that i try to go out with friends, soomething happens to make them cancel, or not be able too. And here i am, cutting myself because i dont&rsquo; think that no one loves me because i&rsquo;m worthless, fat, ugly, not fun, depressing, needy, scary, boring. Whatever.
