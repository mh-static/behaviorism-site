This is essentially a business analysis of the potential sales of ADHD drugs.  Here are some quotes:
&#34;European countries are increasingly adopting the US diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV), resulting in more and more diagnoses of ADHD. Clearer guidelines for diagnosis of ADHD in both adults and children and revisions to ADHD treatment methods will be released in the DSM-V in 2013, superceding [sic] the DSM-IV which was last revised in 2000. This may possibly result in a rise in ADHD diagnoses in the US, and potentially further afield.&#34;
&ldquo;The US leads the pack in terms of ADHD treatment, holding the highest diagnosis rate for both adults and children. The ADHD market has shown a steady increase in the number of prescriptions in the pediatric population, although this has started to slow down and has potentially reached a plateau. The market will continue to grow, however, due to the increase in the number of adult patients being diagnosed and treated. A relatively open attitude to psychiatric treatment, as well as direct-to-consumer and physician marketing, is leading to increased rates of adult ADHD diagnosis in the US.&rdquo;">

<p>This is essentially a business analysis of the potential sales of ADHD drugs.  Here are some quotes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The US leads the pack in terms of ADHD treatment, holding the highest diagnosis rate for both adults and children.
