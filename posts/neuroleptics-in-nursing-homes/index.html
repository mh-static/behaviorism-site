  <div class="post-content"><p>Earlier this year, The American Society of Consultant Pharmacists published a <a href="https://www.ascp.com/articles/antipsychotic-medication-use-nursing-facility-residents">report on the use of neuroleptic drugs in nursing homes</a>.  According to this report, 25% of nursing home residents receive neuroleptic drugs.</p>
<p>In general, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) consider these prescriptions appropriate only if the recipient is psychotic.  (Obviously we could discuss this at length, but let&rsquo;s set that issue aside for now.)</p>
<p>What CMS considers entirely <i>inappropriate</i>, however, is prescribing these products to residents with dementia as a way of controlling &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; behaviors such as wandering, being abusive, or resisting care.</p>
<p>In January 2013, CMS produced a 43-page report on this topic titled: <i><a href="http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Outreach/NPC/Downloads/2013-01-31-Dementia-Care-presentation.pdf">Improving Dementia Care and Reducing Unnecessary Use of Antipsychotic Medications in Nursing Homes</a>.</i></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"High prevalence rates of antipsychotic medication use in nursing home residents have been reported in several studies; Much of the use is in residents with a diagnosis of dementia.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">According to CMS’s Quality Measure/Quality Indicator report, between July and September 2010, 39.4% of nursing home residents nationwide who had cognitive impairment and behavioral issues <i>but no diagnosis of psychosis</i> or related conditions received antipsychotic medications." [Emphasis added]</p>
Antipsychotic, or more accurately, neuroleptic, drugs provide little or no treatment benefit for people with dementia.  The risks, however, are considerable, including<strong> tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, infections such as pneumonia, and reduced life expectancy.</strong>
<p>In their report, the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists wrote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It is important to note that the Food and Drug Administration requires a 'black box' warning on all antipsychotics about an increased risk of mortality when used in older adults with dementia."</p>
In May of last year, CMS launched a program designed to reduce this off-label prescribing by a modest 15% by the end of 2012.  In fact, for all their efforts, the rate declined by only <i>8%</i> nationally.  [Quoted in <a href="http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/2013/05/23/nursing-homes/"><i>No restraint at drug-dosing New York nursing homes</i> </a>in The New York World.]

Why are neuroleptics, with all their well-established risks, being used so widely <strong>to control "difficult" behavior in nursing homes</strong>?  And why is CMS unable to put a stop to the practice?
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quote from Gwen Olsen&rsquo;s 2009 book <i>Confessions of an Rx Drug Pusher:</i></p>

Ms. Olsen has been out of the business for several years now, but maybe things haven't changed that much.  The <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?showYear=2012&amp;indexType=i">pharmaceutical industry gave $234 million to politicians last year</a>.  I guess they wouldn't be doing that if it didn't buy them something.
