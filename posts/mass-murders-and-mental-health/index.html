Apparently the mother was walking near her home with the baby in a stroller. She was approached by the two boys, who demanded money. The article gave few details, but the baby was shot to death, and the mother was shot in the leg, apparently trying to protect the child.\nThe second article was about two teenage girls (14 and 15) who hijacked a car driven by an 89-year-old woman. They shoved her into the trunk, and kept her locked in there for two days while they drove around.\nObviously I have no way of verifying the reports, but we read stories like this almost every day, and it is clear that there are a great many young people today who have no regard for other people, and who kill and maim other people with no compunction.\nTrying to identify these individuals before they kill and main might be a useful endeavor. I don’t know. Maybe they can’t be spotted in advance. And maybe there are civil liberty issues in moving against someone on the basis that he might commit a crime.\nBut mental health screenings will make no contribution to this process. The call for mental health screenings is just one more opportunistic marketing ploy from pharma-psychiatry to promote their own agenda, and to expand the sale of psychoactive drugs.\nThe real question – the critical question ­– is why are we raising so many children who lack even the most rudimentary regard for their fellow human beings? What has gone wrong in our child-rearing? Are today’s parents not as interested in their children’s upbringing as formerly? Are communities so fragmented and isolative that children don’t get opportunities to react meaningfully with other children? Do children not play together enough? Is the blame-absolving message of psychiatry undermining the time-honored methods of parenting that prevailed in former times? Is it drugs? Is there too much violence on screen and video? Are there too many guns?\nI don’t know the answers - but I do know that mental health screenings is not an answer. We need well-designed and well-conducted studies. We need to identify what has gone wrong with our child-rearing practices and what we can do as a society to move this in a positive direction. We need facts and evidence-based strategies. We don’t need more pharma-psychiatry infomercials!\n",
