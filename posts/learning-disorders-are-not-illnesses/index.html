  <div class="post-content"><p>The notion of learning disorders gained momentum during the 50’s and 60’s, when it began to be appreciated in professional circles that there were a small number of individuals who, although quite bright, seemed to experience inordinate difficulty learning to read.  They juxtaposed letters or did not seem to readily “see” the patterns of letters in words, and the term “dyslexia” was used to describe this condition, which was relatively rare in school-aged children.</p>
<p>Today DSM-IV identifies three different sub-categories of learning disorder:  reading disorder, mathematics disorder, and disorder of written expression.  Clearly the general concept has expanded markedly during the intervening decades, and DSM’s own estimate of total prevalence for all categories among school-aged children is five percent and in the general population (i.e., including adults) is two to ten percent.</p>
<p>DSM defines a learning disorder as a condition in which the individual’s performance in the area in question (reading, writing or arithmetic) is substantially below expectations given his intelligence, educational opportunities, etc&hellip;  “Substantially below” is defined as two standard deviations, which in fairness to DSM does constitute a very major discrepancy.  A child of average intelligence would have to be reading at or close to the bottom of the class level to meet this criterion.</p>
<p>The inherent drawback in the DSM definition, however, is that it takes no cognizance of the <em>reason</em> for the discrepancy.</p>
<p>If a child’s reading level is extremely low because his brain can’t process letters, DSM considers him to have a mental disorder called “reading disorder.”  Another child of similar intelligence and education whose reading is similarly low will receive exactly the same diagnosis, even though his inability stems not from a neurological problem, but from laziness, lack of motivation, or general failure on the part of the parents to instill age-appropriate habits of discipline and self-control.  It is obvious from even a most cursory familiarity with the day-to-day dynamics in our schools that the numbers of such children have increased markedly in the past two decades, and that it is this increase that has swollen the ranks of the “learning disordered.”</p>
