De-Medicalizing Misery, edited by Mark Rapley, Joanna Moncrieff, and Jacqui Dillon
This book is a collection of papers by various authors, most of whom have experience working with clients and are also associated with prestigious British universities.
Here are some quotes:
“The architects of modern biological psychiatry have constructed a system that does little justice to the myriad problems it claims to address, while creating multiple iatrogenic problems for those to whom it is applied.” (p 1)">

Note: Just for the record, I have no financial stake in this or any book I have recommended. My only concern is to spread the word: modern psychiatry is based on a spurious philosophy and is damaging and destructive.\n",
