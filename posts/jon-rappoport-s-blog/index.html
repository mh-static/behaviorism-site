Fewer and fewer people wanted to see a psychiatrist for help, for talk therapy. All sorts of new therapies were popping up. The competition was leaving medical psychiatry in the dust.\nAs Dr. Peter Breggin describes it in his landmark book, Toxic Psychiatry, a deal was struck. Drug companies would bankroll psychiatry and rescue it. These companies would pour money into professional conferences, journals, research. In return, they wanted 'science' that would promote mental disease as a biological fact, a gateway into the drugs. Everyone would win—except the patient.\nSo the studies were rolled out, and the list of mental disorders expanded. The FDA was in on the deal as well, as evidenced by their drug 'safety' approvals, in the face of the obvious damage these drugs were doing.\nSo this is how we arrived at where we are. This was the plan, and it worked.\nUnder the cover story, it was all fraud all the time. Without much of a stretch, you could say psychiatry has been the most widespread profiling operation in the history of the human race. Its goal has been to bring humans everywhere into its system. It hardly matters which label a person is painted with, as long as it adds up to a diagnosis and a prescription of drugs.\"\nJon addresses the spurious and destructive nature of psychiatry in no-nonsense, hard-hitting language. His material is relevant and current, and very much worth reading.
