For example, if a woman describes inserting razor blades into her vagina, our response would not be to conceptualise this as part of an illness. Rather we would see this as an understandable and logical response in someone who has had a lifetime of sexual abuse and sexual violence and is creatively trying to find a way to stop it from happening again.\"\n\"As an organisation set up to be an alternative to psychiatric services we are fiercely opposed to the use of psychiatric diagnoses. We pride ourselves on providing a non-medical approach to working with extreme mental distress. Our philosophy is about being alongside people in crisis, not treating them. We also believe passionately in the transformative and healing power of human connection.\"\n\"The mental health system can disempower people further due to the lack of control that people often experience within services.\"\n\"The person-centred approach asserts that all behaviour is understandable\"\nPlease read the complete document. There are a great many interesting and thought-provoking quotes from service users. The service was founded in 1999 by a group of service users as an alternative to mainstream psychiatry, and reports a Social Return on Investment ratio of slightly over five to one.\n",
