<p>The study found that <strong>fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil) were associated with an <i>increased</i> risk of major malformations</strong>.  Paxil was also found to be associated with increased risk of cardiac malformations.</p>

<p>The 95% confidence interval (CI) means that we can be 95% certain that the <i>real</i> value of the odds ratio (as opposed to the value found in the particular samples studied) falls inside the interval stated.</p>
