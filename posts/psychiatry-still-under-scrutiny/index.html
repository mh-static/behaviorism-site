The concepts that dominate modern psychiatry are not based on science - as is real medicine - but on faith and belief. It is more like religion than science.\nMy own position on the condition called ADHD is that paying attention is what behaviorists call an “operant,” which translates roughly as a voluntary act. Like all operants, it increases in frequency if it is reinforced and decreases in frequency if it is not. Chronic failure to pay attention to what the adult world defines as important is almost always a function of parenting practices.\nIt needs to be acknowledged, however, that the DSM criteria for the condition known as ADHD involve much more than not paying attention. Many of the criteria items are simply examples of disobedience and misbehavior.\nI have written extensively on this topic elsewhere.\n",
