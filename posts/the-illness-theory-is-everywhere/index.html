  <div class="post-content"><p>A few days ago, there was an interesting item in the Dear Abby column of our local newspaper.  Dear Abby is a general advice column written by Jeanne Phillips, and is widely read.</p>
<p>The letter in question was written by &ldquo;Sibling Standing By,&rdquo; who described his/her 63 year old sister as someone who &ldquo;…takes no responsibility for her health.&rdquo; The sibling goes on to say:</p>

Ms. Phillips frequently endorses the bio-psychiatric position that depression is an illness and can be "treated" by physicians.
<p>For an advice column of this sort to succeed, it must have the three R&rsquo;s:  readability, relevance, and resonance.</p>
<p>Readability and relevance are obvious.  What I mean by <i>resonance</i> is that the advice tendered has to <i>resonate</i> strongly with a large proportion of the readership.  In this sense, Dear Abby is a kind of barometer of societal views on a wide range of issues.</p>
<p>But the Dear Abby column isn&rsquo;t just a <i>reflection</i> of societal views, it is also to some extent a <i>shaper</i> of public opinion.  <strong>By repeating frequently the mantra that depression is an illness to be treated by drugs, the Dear Abby column has become a significant factor in the dissemination and acceptance of this spurious notion.</strong></p>
