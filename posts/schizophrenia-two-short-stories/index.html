<p>In the early 70&rsquo;s I worked in Grendon Prison in England.  The facility was run on the lines of a therapeutic community – lots of meetings, groups, etc&hellip;  One of the prisoners – let&rsquo;s call him William – was serving time for burglary.  He was about 24 years old, and during his intake interviews he told us that he was a member of a small quasi-religious sect who believed that doomsday was imminent and that they would be the chosen few.  He talked about these matters openly and with a good measure of passion, and after a few weeks the other prisoners were describing him as &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; and a &ldquo;nutcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had a great many professional visitors at Grendon.  Social workers, nurses, psychologists, etc.., would spend a few days observing and attending our meetings.  On one occasion we had some newly-trained psychiatric nurses on the unit, and during one of the plenary meetings there was some focus on William, and he recounted (again passionately) his end-of-times story, and defended it vigorously against the dismissive input from the other prisoners.</p>
