      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just read &lt;em&gt;The Dark Threads,&lt;/em&gt; by Jean Davison (Accent Press Ltd, 2009)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s autobiographical, and describes with great detail and insight how a young woman of 18 years, whose only problem was acute shyness coupled with a yearning for some meaning in life, made the mistake of visiting a psychiatrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean describes how she was &lt;strong&gt;bullied into accepting psychiatric &amp;ldquo;treatment.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; She was &lt;strong&gt;drugged into a zombie-like stupor and given electric shock &amp;ldquo;treatment.&amp;rdquo;  &lt;/strong&gt;She describes graphically the disempowering and humiliating aspects of &amp;ldquo;treatment,&amp;rdquo; and the endless patronizing condescension.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DELICATE THINGS REQUIRE DELICATE HANDLING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, one of my hobbies was making small transistor radios.  It sounds complicated, but is well within the reach of an average 15-year-old.  You get some magazine articles, learn how to read a circuit, and learn how to use a soldering iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transistor is a small device – about half the size of a pencil eraser – with three wires coming out of it.  In building a radio receiver, the transistors have to be soldered to other devices which are in turn soldered to other devices, etc…  The soldering iron is plugged into a wall outlet, but no mains electricity reaches the tip of the iron.  However, tiny eddy currents can circulate in the tip, and although they are only of the order of &lt;i&gt;milliamps&lt;/i&gt;, they can burn a transistor in seconds.  What you have to do is unplug the iron from the socket, make the joint with the tip&amp;rsquo;s retained heat, and then replug the iron to have it ready for the next joint.  The point being that &lt;i&gt;delicate things require delicate handling&lt;/i&gt;, and that &lt;strong&gt;electricity can be very destructive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
