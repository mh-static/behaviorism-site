      <title>Benzo Withdrawal: Another Story</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another benzo withdrawal story on Mad in America:  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/reality-clash-when-benzo-withdrawal-meets-parenthood/&#34;&gt;The 99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Mile: When Benzo Withdrawal Meets Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt; by Melissa Bond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa recounts that when her Down&amp;rsquo;s syndrome son was 18 months old and her baby daughter was three months, she consulted a physician because of problems with insomnia and consequent exhaustion.  He prescribed 2 mg of Ativan daily, which he increased to 6 mg within six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melissa describes in detail the problems of withdrawal, and the extreme measures she had to take to cope with this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More on Benzodiazepine Withdrawal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/03/17/withdrawal-from-benzodiazepines/#.UUknoxyG0eU&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; on this topic, I mentioned that benzo withdrawal can be dangerous, but it&amp;rsquo;s been drawn to my attention, by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, that perhaps I didn&amp;rsquo;t adequately stress &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; dangerous it can be in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click &lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/2012/01/21/benzodetoxdangers/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, you can read Monica&amp;rsquo;s own account of her experience in a detox center in Florida.  It&amp;rsquo;s a thought-provoking article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because for many years benzos were dished out so liberally, there is still a &lt;strong&gt;mistaken perception that they are relatively safe and benign&lt;/strong&gt;, which is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&#39;ve recently come across an article by Matt Samet called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/03/social-vacuum/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Social Vacuum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s dated March 2013, and was published on Robert Whitaker&#39;s website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;Matt had been taking a benzodiazepine for some time, and while on a tapering withdrawal, he experienced some distressing symptoms, including some acute social discomfort.  (For a full account of benzo withdrawal –&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine_withdrawal_syndrome&#34;&gt; click here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Business As Usual</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/business-as-usual/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Lane, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2010/04/15/the-so-called-mental-illnesses-are-not-illnesses/&#34;&gt;Shyness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has written an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light-benzodiazepine&#34;&gt;interesting post&lt;/a&gt;.  The gist of the matter is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines (benzos for short) that are promoted by Pharma and prescribed by psychiatrists to “treat” anxiety.  (As if anxiety were an illness!)  See my post on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2009/05/07/anxiety-disorders/&#34;&gt;So-called Anxiety Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzos include such household names as Valium, Librium, Ativan, Xanax, etc..  When introduced in the 1960’s, these drugs were widely touted as “safe” tranquilizers.  Readers may remember Valium as “mother’s little helper,” so called because it was marketed to millions of harried housewives as they struggled to adapt to an increasingly complex and multi-faceted lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
