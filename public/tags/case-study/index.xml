      <description>&lt;p&gt;In DSM-IV, conversion disorder is described as distressful symptoms (or symptom) of voluntary motor or sensory function that &amp;ldquo;suggest&amp;rdquo; a neurological or other illness even though no actual pathology is present, and there is reason to believe that the problem is psychological in origin.  It has sometimes been called hysterical blindness, hysterical paralysis, hysterical anesthesia, etc…  This diagnosis is being retained in DSM-5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevalence estimates vary from 1 in 10,000 to 50 in 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Involuntary Commitment – A Case Study</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago I was director of a county mental health center in an Eastern state.  Shortly after taking the position, I became concerned that &lt;strong&gt;clients were being involuntarily committed too readily&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;without exploration of other options&lt;/strong&gt;.  I issued an instruction that all such activity had to be approved by a middle manager before it could proceed.  This measure aroused enormous resistance from the front-line staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one client – let&amp;rsquo;s call him Charlie – who was committed to the State Hospital every year, usually in July.  Every July, he would become &amp;ldquo;agitated,&amp;rdquo; would scream profanities at his elderly mother, and break things around the house.  He carried a &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Call Yourself That:  The Harmful Effects of Negative Self-labeling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we were young, most of us devoted a good deal of time and energy to squabbling with other children.  To the dismay of our parents, we because adept in the use of impolite language, and kept our stock of insulting words and phrases up-to-date.  As adults we are more socially sophisticated.  We no longer call one another rude names – at least not openly.  Tragically, however, many people go through their entire adult lives calling &lt;i&gt;themselves&lt;/i&gt; names, which although not as vulgar as the insults of childhood, are considerably more destructive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>If Depression Is Not An Illness, What Is It?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2009/07/28/depression/#.URp1BKVEEeU&#34;&gt;Elsewhere on this site&lt;/a&gt;, I have argued that depression is not an illness, but rather is an&lt;strong&gt; adaptive mechanism that encourages us to make changes &lt;/strong&gt;in our habits or our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written about what I call the seven natural anti-depressants:  good nutrition; fresh air; sunshine (in moderation); physical activity; purposeful activity; good relationships; and adequate and regular sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question has often been posed:  Why does this adaptive mechanism apparently not work in some cases?  Why is it that for some people the unpleasant feeling fails to act as a spur to make changes, and instead the person sinks further into despondency and inactivity?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
