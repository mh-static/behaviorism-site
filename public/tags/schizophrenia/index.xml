      <title>Do Major Tranquilizers Make Things Worse?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 19 of this year an article by Martin Harrow and Thomas Jobe was published in the Schizophrenia Bulletin:  &lt;i&gt;Does Long-Term Treatment of Schizophrenia with Antipsychotic Medications Facilitate Recovery?&lt;/i&gt;  You can see it&lt;a href=&#34;http://femhc.org/Portals/2/Publications/FEMHC%20Grant%20Project%20Publications/2013_March19_Harrow_Jobe_SchizophreniaBulletin_Do%20Long-Term%20Tx%20of%20Schiz%20w%20Antipsychotics%20Facilitate%20Recovery.pdf&#34;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;.  The term &amp;ldquo;antipsychotics&amp;rdquo; embraces drugs such as Haldol, Risperdal, Thorazine, etc…  I prefer the term major tranquilizers, because it is more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drs. Harrow and Job have conducted a long-term (15-20 year) study of people diagnosed with the condition known as schizophrenia. They found that individuals who had been given &amp;ldquo;anti-psychotics&amp;rdquo; continuously for these long periods showed &amp;ldquo;…considerable psychopathology and few sustained periods of recovery.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lab Tests for Psychiatric Disorders – More Promises</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/lab-tests-for-psychiatric-disorders-more-promises/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come across (courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TallaTrialogue&#34;&gt;Tallaght Trialogue&lt;/a&gt;) an article in &lt;i&gt;Current Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt; (Feb 2013) on this topic.  The author is Henry A. Nasrallah, M.D., and you can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/article_pages.asp?aid=11050&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nasrallah, who is Editor-in-Chief of &lt;i&gt;Current Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, states that there are 273 bio-markers for schizophrenia.  But wait.  Dr. Nasrallah goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;None of the individual 273 biomarkers alone can serve as a diagnostic tool for the schizophrenias because there will be high rates of false positives and false negatives.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 5, 2013, a bipartisan panel of leading mental health experts and parents of children with &amp;ldquo;mental disorders&amp;rdquo; held a conversation (that&amp;rsquo;s newspeak for meeting) in Washington D.C. on the topic: Violence and Severe Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invited panelists were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;Thomas Insel, MD, Director of NIMH
Harold Koplewicz, MD, President of Child Mind Institute
E. Fuller Torrey, MD, Founder of Treatment Advocacy Center
Michael Welner, MD, Founder and Chairman of The Forensic Panel
Michael Fitzpatrick, MSW, Director of NAMI
And three parents of &#34;diagnosed&#34; children&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Schizophrenia – Two Short Stories</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/schizophrenia-two-short-stories/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 70&amp;rsquo;s I worked in Grendon Prison in England.  The facility was run on the lines of a therapeutic community – lots of meetings, groups, etc&amp;hellip;  One of the prisoners – let&amp;rsquo;s call him William – was serving time for burglary.  He was about 24 years old, and during his intake interviews he told us that he was a member of a small quasi-religious sect who believed that doomsday was imminent and that they would be the chosen few.  He talked about these matters openly and with a good measure of passion, and after a few weeks the other prisoners were describing him as &amp;ldquo;crazy&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;nutcase.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Involuntary Commitment – A Case Study</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/involuntary-commitment-a-case-study/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago I was director of a county mental health center in an Eastern state.  Shortly after taking the position, I became concerned that &lt;strong&gt;clients were being involuntarily committed too readily&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;without exploration of other options&lt;/strong&gt;.  I issued an instruction that all such activity had to be approved by a middle manager before it could proceed.  This measure aroused enormous resistance from the front-line staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one client – let&amp;rsquo;s call him Charlie – who was committed to the State Hospital every year, usually in July.  Every July, he would become &amp;ldquo;agitated,&amp;rdquo; would scream profanities at his elderly mother, and break things around the house.  He carried a &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Muddled Thinking and Psychiatric &#34;Diagnoses&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until just a few years ago, the spurious nature of mental illness received little or no attention either in professional circles or in the general media. There were a few of us &amp;ldquo;cranks&amp;rdquo; who poked away at the issue, but peer condemnation was usually swift and outspoken.  On one occasion I was called an &amp;ldquo;anti-science Nazi&amp;rdquo; for daring to suggest that the condition known as ADHD might have more to do with ineffective parental discipline than with brain chemistry.  We were voices in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry – the Pseudoscience</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatry-the-pseudoscience/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As most readers of this website are aware, there is a great deal of resistance to the soon-to-be-released DSM-5.  There is even a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/02/dsm-5-boycott-launched/&#34;&gt;Boycott DSM-5 Committee &lt;/a&gt;established by Jack Carney, and many people are suggesting that practitioners use the World Health Organization&amp;rsquo;s (WHO&amp;rsquo;s) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the general context of this debate, I have come across an article by Philip Thomas, M.D. – &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/02/pinball-wizards-and-the-doomed-project-of-psychiatric-diagnosis/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Pinball Wizards and the Doomed Project of Psychiatric Diagnosis.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;  Dr. Thomas points out that &amp;ldquo;…it’s hard to imagine that the criticisms raised about DSM-5 won’t also apply to the ICD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;Mental Illness&#34; and Genes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/mental-illness-and-genes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jay Joseph, PhD has posted an interesting piece: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/02/five-decades-of-gene-finding-failures-in-psychiatry/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Five Decades of Gene Finding Failures in Psychiatry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt; (Robert Whitaker&amp;rsquo;s site).  It is well worth a read.  The general content of the article is clear from the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Two generations of molecular genetic researchers have attempted, yet failed, to discover the genes that they believe underlie the major psychiatric disorders.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Despite the sequencing of the human genome and the publication of more than 1,700 schizophrenia molecular genetic studies, we have witnessed over 40 years of gene finding claims, and over 40 years of subsequently non-replicated findings.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Schizophrenia – Not an Illness</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/schizophrenia-not-an-illness/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late adolescence and early adulthood is arguably the most difficult period of life.  Transitioning from childhood to adulthood entails many challenges.  The young person (male or female) is expected to emancipate successfully from parents; launch a career; and find a partner – all in the space of a few short years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals cope remarkably well.  Others squeak through, and a small minority “crash and burn.”  The latter group usually return home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Schizophrenia Label - Damaging and Dangerous</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/schizophrenia-label-damaging-and-dangerous/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2012 11:03:19 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/schizophrenia-label-damaging-and-dangerous/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s an interesting article&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/12/22844/&#34;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Inquiry into the Schizophrenia Label (ISL) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Robert Whitaker’s website &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Philip Thomas, M.D. and other researchers have been asking mental health clients how they perceived the &lt;strong&gt;schizophrenia label.&lt;/strong&gt;  They received nearly 500 responses, and found that &lt;em&gt;more than 80%&lt;/em&gt; of responders described the label as &lt;strong&gt;damaging and dangerous.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They question the validity and usefulness of the “diagnosis” and tentatively suggest that it may need to be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cinema Shooting – Psychiatric Defense</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/cinema-shooting-psychiatric-defense/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was widely reported last week that James Holmes, the alleged cinema shooter, will be pursuing a “mental illness” defense.  Details are scarce because the judge has issued a gag order, but it is likely, given the available information, that the lawyers will argue that because of his psychiatric history he is incompetent to stand trial.  It is also likely that they will bring in some eminent psychiatrist(s) who will confirm his “diagnosis” and claim that at the time of the offense he didn’t know what he was doing, or something similar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every society in every generation makes errors.  Some of the errors are minor.  Some are major.  One of the great errors of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was this:  we accepted the spurious notion that a wide range of life’s problems were in fact &lt;em&gt;illnesses&lt;/em&gt;.  This spurious notion was initiated with good intentions – to provide shelter and humanitarian care for a relatively small number of individuals whose plight was truly dreadful.  But then the concept of mental illness took off, fuelled largely by the efforts of psychiatrists to legitimize their status as “real” doctors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Schizophrenia Is Not An Illness (Part 3)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/schizophrenia-is-not-an-illness-part-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;Hallucinations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Schizophrenia Part 1, we noted that the APA lists hallucinations as one of the primary “symptoms” of schizophrenia.  The APA defines an hallucination as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“A sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ.” (DSM-IV-TR, p 823)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In other words: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or feeling something that isn’t really there.  Typically the individual who has been “diagnosed” with schizophrenia reports that he hears voices that accuse him of some wrong or exhort him to some action, and sometimes threaten him with punishment or retribution.
&lt;p&gt;A number of points need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Schizophrenia Is Not an Illness (Part 2)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: underline;&#34;&gt;Delusions, contd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post I pointed out that schizophrenia as defined by DSM is a confusing collection of human problems with no evidence of a common etiology or indeed any valid justification for including them under a common heading.  I discussed delusions and made the point that cognitive distortions of this kind are a normal response to failure.  When the experience of failure is profound and pervasive, the delusional speech tends to be commensurately extreme.  Delusions are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; symptomatic of an underlying illness, but rather are a normal human reaction to severe stress or profound failure, particularly in the late teens/early adulthood phase of life.  This is the time of life in which our general coping skills are subjected to their first serious tests, and when people experience profound failure at this time, there is a risk that they will drift towards delusional speech.  Onset of delusional speech is typically &lt;a href=&#34;http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/162/1/80&#34;&gt;later for women&lt;/a&gt; than men, and probably corresponds with the process of giving birth and caring for small children.  The potential for strong feelings of failure is high at this point of life also.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;&#34;&gt;The APA defines schizophrenia by the presence of two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a one-month period:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1)   delusions
(2)   hallucinations
(3)   disorganized speech
(4)   grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
(5)   negative symptoms i.e. affective flattening, alogia or avolition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of the disturbance must have been present for at least six months and there must be significant deficits in one or more areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations or self-care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
