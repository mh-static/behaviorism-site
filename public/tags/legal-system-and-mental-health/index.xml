      <description>&lt;p&gt;The central theme of this website is that there are no mental illnesses, and that the widespread medicalization of ordinary human problems is spurious and destructive.  These concepts have been around for decades, but in the last four or five years have &amp;ldquo;taken off,&amp;rdquo; and are finding a good deal of acceptance among practitioners, academics, clients, and the general public.  Change is in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A matter that is sometimes overlooked, however, is that the &lt;strong&gt;concept of &amp;ldquo;mental illness&amp;rdquo; and its &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo; by psychiatrists and other professionals is deeply embedded in the legal system of most states and countries&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
