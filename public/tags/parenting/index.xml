      <title>In DSM-5, A-D-H-D Still Spells Misbehavior</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a central theme of this website that there are no mental illnesses/disorders, and that the psychiatric medicalization of ordinary human problems is arbitrary, spurious, and destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread acceptance of ADHD as a mental illness/chemical imbalance has no scientific underpinning, but rather is based on marketing and promotion.  The ADHD &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; is particularly destructive, in that it targets &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt;, and serves as the justification for &amp;ldquo;treating&amp;rdquo; these children with dangerous drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatric &#34;Diagnoses&#34; for Children</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatric-diagnoses-for-children/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, I came across an article by Marilyn Wedge, PhD.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;i&gt;Six Problems with Psychiatric Diagnosis for Children. &lt;/i&gt;  You can read it &lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/2012/10/08/psych-dx-for-children/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Psychiatric diagnoses contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders are not classified by causes like genuine medical diseases.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Perhaps worst of all, a child who has been labeled with a psychiatric diagnosis grows up believing that there is something wrong with her, that she is somehow “abnormal.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mental Health and the Schools</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was about eleven or twelve, I had reasonably good social skills with my peers, but I was shy and awkward with adults. Our neighbor, Mrs. F., was a very pleasant lady who loved to spend time in her front yard with her flowers.  Often, as I came up the walk to our door, I would pass her.  She always gave me a nice greeting, to which I would respond by gazing at my toes and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Play Therapy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/play-therapy/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/play-therapy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across an interesting article &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiddaman.blogspot.co.nz/2013/02/psychiatric-medication-or-play-therapy.html&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psychiatric Medication or Play Therapy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bob Fiddaman, a New Zealand writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article compares the efficacy and dangers of play therapy vs. pharmaceutical products for children with various problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;…play therapy outcome studies support the efficacy of this intervention with children suffering from various emotional and behavioral difficulties.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on marketing psychiatric medication.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Front groups that purport to fly the mental health flag are, in fact, nothing more than agents, pimps for the pharmaceutical industry.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mandatory Mental Health Screenings for Schoolchildren</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/mandatory-mental-health-screenings-for-schoolchildren/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A regular commenter to this website has drawn my attention to a bill that has been proposed in the Connecticut state legislature.  The bill would require public school and homeschooled children to be assessed by mental health practitioners at grades 6, 8, 10, and 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, sponsored by Senator Toni Harp and Representative Toni Walker, is in response to the recent Sandy Hook murders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it starts.  Given the built-in vagueness of the DSM, and the inclusiveness bias of the mental health business, the outcome of these screenings (should the bill become law) is predictable: more and more parents disempowered with regards to their parenting responsibilities; more drugged children, and, tragically, more mass murders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Parenting and Psychiatry</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/parenting-and-psychiatry/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a week ago an article appeared on the ‘net concerning an attempt by parents to ban ice cream vendors from a playground in Brooklyn, New York.  The piece was reprinted in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/slopers_creamy_river_lcaxb1lj4D0SHqo4f2K3GO&#34;&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently some of the parents are upset because the arrival of the vendors stimulates requests for ice cream from the children, which results in confrontation and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsible parents everywhere will recognize the dilemma.  Ice cream has little or no nutritional value, but children like it.  So do we stand our ground or do we give in?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sexual Disorders are Not Illnesses (Part 2)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/sexual-disorders-are-not-illnesses-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 10:35:29 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post I described frotteurism, which the APA lists as one of their mental disorders/illnesses.  The central theme of this blog is that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; no mental illnesses – that mental illnesses are essentially psychiatrists’ ways of conceptualizing ordinary human problems for the purposes of consolidating turf and legitimizing the use of drugs to alter people’s behavior and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the behaviors in question are not problems.  They certainly are.  Frotteurism is a case in point.  A man who uses the crowd cover of trains and buses to press his genitals against non-consenting females clearly &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a problem.  The question is:  how can we &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; this behavior?  Why does he do it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/conduct-disorder-and-oppositional-defiant-disorder/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONDUCT DISORDER
&lt;/strong&gt;
The essential feature of Conduct Disorder, according to the APA, is a “repetitive and persistent pattern” of rule breaking or activity which violates other people’s basic rights.  The manual identifies four broad categories of behavior under this heading:  aggression; destruction of property; theft or deceitfulness; and serious violation of rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSM goes on to state that individuals with this disorder display little concern for the feelings or welfare of others, are frequently callous and indifferent to other people’s pain and loss, and show little in the way of feelings of guilt or remorse.  Poor frustration tolerance, irritability, temper tantrums, and recklessness are cited as frequently associated features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Can They Just Invent Illnesses?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-can-they-just-invent-illnesses/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2009 12:09:48 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/how-can-they-just-invent-illnesses/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The notion of a professional group such as the APA sitting in their councils and committees inventing illnesses for themselves to treat seems so preposterous that a measure of disbelief on the part of the reader is understandable.  In its historical context, however, the development is not so surprising.  The original 1952 DSM was very simple and unpretentious, and whilst part of the APA’s motivation in drafting the document was undoubtedly to draw some credibility and respectability to their profession, there is at the same time nothing to suggest any great drive at that time towards aggrandizement or service expansion.  However, having agreed in 1952 that neurosis was a form of mental disorder, it was inevitable that subsequent revisions of the manual would attempt to define this feature further and look for subdivisions of the general category.  This, of course, is exactly what has happened, and the current version of DSM lists literally dozens of disorders of this sort, although the general term neurosis is no longer used.  (For an interesting discussion of this matter, see Karen Franklin’s post at &lt;a href=&#34;http://forensicpsychologist.blogspot.com/2008/10/dsm-makeover-what-will-they-come-up.html&#34;&gt;In The News&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
