      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 5, 2013, a bipartisan panel of leading mental health experts and parents of children with &amp;ldquo;mental disorders&amp;rdquo; held a conversation (that&amp;rsquo;s newspeak for meeting) in Washington D.C. on the topic: Violence and Severe Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invited panelists were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;Thomas Insel, MD, Director of NIMH
Harold Koplewicz, MD, President of Child Mind Institute
E. Fuller Torrey, MD, Founder of Treatment Advocacy Center
Michael Welner, MD, Founder and Chairman of The Forensic Panel
Michael Fitzpatrick, MSW, Director of NAMI
And three parents of &#34;diagnosed&#34; children&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Childhood Bipolar Disorder</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to about 1994, childhood bipolar disorder was virtually unheard of.  DSM-III-R (1987), in the section on manic episode, states, “…studies indicate that the mean age at onset is in the early 20s.  However…a sizable number of new cases appear after age 50.”(p 216)  Of course a &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; age of onset in the early 20’s could include young children.  The section on major depressive episode, however, contains the following:  “The average age of onset is in the late 20s, but a major depressive episode may begin at any age, including infancy.” (p 220)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing this post as a response to a comment posted by &lt;a href=&#34;http://drpullen.com/&#34;&gt;medical blog&lt;/a&gt; in my previous post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2011/02/24/more-on-so-called-bipolar-disorder/#comments&#34;&gt;More on So-called Bipolar Disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2001 I became very ill.  The symptoms were exhaustion and mild nosebleeds. I went to three different practitioners, but they all were dismissive of my concerns, assured me that I was in good health, and sent me on my way.   On August 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of that year I was admitted to the hospital in Greeley, Colorado with complete kidney failure.  The nephrologist at the hospital gave me the &lt;em&gt;diagnosis&lt;/em&gt; that had eluded the earlier doctors:  Wegener’s Granulomatosis - a rare autoimmune disease that attacks lungs, kidneys, and airways. I have been on dialysis every since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I received the following email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;Hi Phil,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;I would like to hear from you how we can survive the bipolar disorder, as I understand bipolar is a very serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;[Name]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The question seems important enough to warrant a more public response, though I have omitted the writer’s name to safeguard confidentiality.
&lt;p&gt;So here’s my reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the condition known as “bipolar disorder” is emphatically NOT a disease.  Rather, it is a loose cluster of behaviors which psychiatrists – in concert with the pharmaceutical companies – have &lt;em&gt;called&lt;/em&gt; an illness with the purpose of selling drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every society in every generation makes errors.  Some of the errors are minor.  Some are major.  One of the great errors of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was this:  we accepted the spurious notion that a wide range of life’s problems were in fact &lt;em&gt;illnesses&lt;/em&gt;.  This spurious notion was initiated with good intentions – to provide shelter and humanitarian care for a relatively small number of individuals whose plight was truly dreadful.  But then the concept of mental illness took off, fuelled largely by the efforts of psychiatrists to legitimize their status as “real” doctors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the anxiety disorders listed in DSM-IV is posttraumatic stress disorder. The criteria for this condition are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;(1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others
(2) the person&#39;s response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Note: in children, this may be expressed instead by disorganized or agitated behavior&lt;/p&gt;</description>
