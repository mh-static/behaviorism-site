      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its &lt;a href=&#34;http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/about-2/&#34;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The ENIGMA consortium is an international effort by leaders worldwide. The Consortium brings together researchers in imaging genomics, neurology and psychiatry, to understand brain structure and function, based on MRI, DTI [Diffusion Tensor Imaging], fMRI, genetic data and many patient populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 40px;&#34;&gt;The best return on our research investments will come from combining our data to achieve the large samples necessary to detect the modest gene effect sizes that we now know are the rule rather [than] the exception for complex traits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On June 23, 2020, Awais Aftab, MD, psychiatrist, published an interview with Ronald Pies, MD, also a psychiatrist, in Psychiatric Times.  The interview was titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/battle-soul-psychiatry-ronald-w-pies-md&#34;&gt;The Battle for the Soul of Psychiatry: Ronald W. Pies, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  I critiqued Dr. Pies&#39; responses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2020/11/05/dr-aftab-interviews-dr-pies/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;In the light of a more recent publication by Dr. Pies, I would like to recall some comments concerning the notorious chemical imbalance deception that the learned doctor made in the earlier interview.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I was a Victim and Came Back: My Empowerment Story</title>

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own story, some fortunate, some less so. Mine is a story of abuse, neglect and mental illness, and the long road back.  I offer it for whatever hope and guidance it may provide for others currently suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Me, A Victim &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1956 when I was thirteen and starting in middle school, my mother had the first of her several operations for intestinal cancer. She told me that she had “tumors,” but that meant one thing to me— cancer.  Around the same time, I, too, began having stomach pains along with constipation like hers. I always had problems getting along with other kids, being teased and harassed, and being nervous, and now I was in great distress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Allen Frances and the Increasing Use of Antidepressants</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 16, 2018, the prestigious and venerable psychiatrist Allen Frances, MD, gave an interview to Christiane Amanpour on CNN.  You can see the video &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/05/17/amanpour-allen-frances-antidepressants-interview.cnn&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s titled &lt;em&gt;How Antidepressant Withdrawal &amp;ldquo;Can Trap People&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how the interview opened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;CA:  &#34;So you know, I just wanted to start by saying that who knew that antidepressants were addictive.  It&#39;s not what you associate with things like antidepressants.  You think of pain-killers, obviously, and drugs and alcohol, and cigarettes.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elimination of the Bereavement Exclusion:  History and Implications</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/elimination-of-the-bereavement-exclusion-history-and-implications/</link>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/elimination-of-the-bereavement-exclusion-history-and-implications/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bereavement exclusion was formally eliminated in the spring of 2013, with the publication of DSM-5.  The exclusion was a provision in earlier editions, that a &amp;ldquo;diagnosis of major depressive disorder&amp;rdquo; could not be assigned to a bereaved person, even though he or she met the criteria, unless certain additional considerations were met.  The history of its elimination provides an interesting example of psychiatry&amp;rsquo;s relentless expansion of its net. The issues involved take us right to the heart of the psychiatric hoax.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 10, 2017, I put up a post titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2017/01/10/the-biological-evidence-for-mental-illness/http:/behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2017/01/10/the-biological-evidence-for-mental-illness/&#34;&gt;The Biological Evidence for &amp;ldquo;Mental Illness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  It was published simultaneously on Mad in America.  The post was a response to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.madinamerica.com/comment-history/?user_id=11436&#34;&gt;earlier comment&lt;/a&gt; from Carolina Partners in Mental Healthcare PLLC, which included the assertion &amp;ldquo;mental illnesses have a long history of biological evidence.&amp;rdquo;  In my January 10 article, I challenged this assertion and pointed out that no such evidence existed.  The article generated some comments, most of which were favorable.  There was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2017/01/10/the-biological-evidence-for-mental-illness/#comment-3097355796&#34;&gt;one comment&lt;/a&gt;, however, from Michael, who asserted:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/the-biological-evidence-for-mental-illness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 2017, I published a short post titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2017/01/02/carrie-fisher-dead-at-age-60/&#34;&gt;Carrie Fisher Dead at Age 60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on Behaviorism and Mental Health.  The article was published simultaneously on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.madinamerica.com/2017/01/carrie-fisher-dead-age-60/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 4, a response from Carolina Partners was entered into the comments string on both sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolina Partners in Mental Healthcare, PLLC, is a large psychiatric group practice based in North Carolina.  According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.carolinapartners.com/&#34;&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt;, they comprise 14 psychiatrists, 7 psychologists, 34 Advanced Practice Nurse Practitioners/Physicians Assistants, and 43 Therapists and Counselors.  They have 27 North Carolina locations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Allen Frances:  Still Blaming Everyone But Himself</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/allen-frances-still-blaming-everyone-but-himself/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2016 05:30:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/allen-frances-still-blaming-everyone-but-himself/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 7, Allen Frances, MD, posted an article on the HuffPost site.  The piece was titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/antidepressants-work-but-_b_9849478.html&#34;&gt;Antidepressants Work, But Only For Really Depressed People&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superficially, the article presents itself as a call to limit the prescribing of the so-called antidepressant drugs to severe cases; but the piece can, I suggest, be more accurately characterized as Dr. Frances&amp;rsquo;s latest attempt to distance himself, and psychiatry in general, from the pill-peddling frenzy that has characterized the profession for the past thirty or forty years&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Germanwings Crash:  Flying Under the Influence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 24, 2015, a twenty-seven-year-old German pilot named Andreas Lubitz flew an Airbus A 320 into a French mountainside, killing himself and the 149 other people on board.  Mr. Lubitz was co-piloting the flight, and he caused the aircraft to crash by locking the pilot out of the flight deck and setting the autopilot to descend to 100 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the descent, he was contacted by civilian and military traffic controllers, and by the crew of another aircraft, but he made no response.  He also ignored repeated and increasingly urgent requests from the captain to be readmitted to the flight deck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gender Wage Gap and Depression/Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/gender-wage-gap-and-depression-anxiety/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2016 05:30:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/gender-wage-gap-and-depression-anxiety/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In their January 2016 issue, the journal Social Science and Medicine published &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26689629&#34;&gt;Unequal depression for equal work? How the wage gap explains gendered disparities in mood disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Jonathan Platt, MPH, Seth Prins, PhD candidate, Lisa Bates, PhD, and Katherine Keyes, PhD, MPH.  All the authors work at Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are more prevalent among women than men. This disparity may be partially due to the effects of structural gender discrimination in the work force, which acts to perpetuate gender differences in opportunities and resources and may manifest as the gender wage gap. We sought to quantify and operationalize the wage gap in order to explain the gender disparity in depression and anxiety disorders, using data from a 2001-2002 US nationally representative survey of 22,581 working adults ages 30-65. Using established Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition methods to account for gender differences in individual-level productivity, our models reduced the wage gap in our sample by 13.5%, from 54% of men&#39;s pay to 67.5% of men&#39;s pay. We created a propensity-score matched sample of productivity indicators to test if the direction of the wage gap moderated the effects of gender on depression or anxiety. Where female income was less than the matched male counterpart, odds of both disorders were significantly higher among women versus men (major depressive disorder OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.95-3.04; generalized anxiety disorder OR: 4.11, 95% CI: 2.80-6.02). Where female income was greater than the matched male, the higher odds ratios for women for both disorders were significantly attenuated (Major Depressive Disorder OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.96-1.52) (Generalized Anxiety Disorder OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.04-2.29). The test for effect modification by sex and wage gap direction was statistically significant for both disorders. Structural forms of discrimination may explain mental health disparities at the population level. Beyond prohibiting overt gender discrimination, policies must be created to address embedded inequalities in procedures surrounding labor markets and compensation in the workplace.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Book Review:  &lt;b&gt;Depression Delusion&lt;/b&gt;, by Terry Lynch, MD, MA</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/book-review-b-depression-delusion-b-by-terry-lynch-md-ma/</link>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/book-review-b-depression-delusion-b-by-terry-lynch-md-ma/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this truly remarkable, and meticulously researched, volume, Dr. Lynch annihilates psychiatry&amp;rsquo;s cherished chemical imbalance theory of depression.  Every facet of this theory, which the author correctly calls a delusion, is critically analyzed and found wanting.  Example after example is provided of psychiatrists promoting this fiction, the factual and logical errors of which are clearly exposed in Dr. Lynch&amp;rsquo;s lucid, seamless, and highly readable prose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book runs to 343 pages, and is laden with factual details, case studies, alternative perspectives, and hard-hitting commentary.  Dr. Lynch does not sit on the sidelines, nor does he seek any kind of collegial compromise with the chemical imbalance theory, which he unambiguously denounces as a groundless and destructive falsehood.  Here are some quotes that I think will convey something of the content, style, and cogency of this vitally important work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;rsquo;ve never used the services of psychologists, never took a
&amp;ldquo;pill.&amp;rdquo;
But I have felt under sudden Depression and Anxiety, like any of you.
Self awareness is necessary. To know when you are not acting
&amp;ldquo;normal.&amp;rdquo;
If we keep hoping for something to happen in an unrealistic way, on
denial, and at the end of the journey we cannot achieve that goal,
DEPRESSION hits&amp;hellip;
How do I beat it?
Redirecting my mind to most realistic goals.
Recharging my mind with optimism, remembering the beautiful things we
have achieved already.
Admiring Nature, the smile of a kid: LOVING.
Exercises help. Art too.
The most important thing?
Think you have come to this world with a purpose.
Think you can help others.
Feel like a champion who can accomplish everything.
And stay away from medication:
The cure is inside you, in your mind, in your soul&amp;hellip;
Be strong!
YOU ARE STRONGER THAN WHAT YOU THINK!!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depression:  A Different Perspective</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-a-different-perspective/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2015 05:30:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-a-different-perspective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently come across an interesting paper:  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://egg.bu.edu/~youssef/SNAP_CLUB/depression.pdf&#34;&gt;How to Understand and then Escape from Depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s written by Saul Youssef, a professor of &lt;em&gt;physics&lt;/em&gt; at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central theme of the paper is that persistent or chronic depression is caused by &amp;ldquo;…an unconscious withdrawal of participation in a person’s own internal decision making processes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;I have been depressed for most of my life, and, at various times, I have tried most of the recommended treatments for depression. I have tried Saint John’s Wort, exercise, Yoga, talk therapy, SSRIs, thyroid supplements and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. In my case, I would say that thyroid supplements, exercise and Yoga helped the most and all of them helped at least a little bit.  Unfortunately, none of these treatments helped dramatically. Then, however, in late 2013 and early 2014, I finally figured it out. I came to understand what was happening in my own head and why it was causing my own depression and I was able to figure out a way to escape. I don’t mean that I am now successfully managing my depression. I mean it’s gone. I am writing up what I think is going on and what I did to escape because I don’t think that my case is unusual. I think that exactly the same thing will work for many people.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/antidepressant-drugs-and-suicide-rates/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica published a study by Göran Isacsson et al.  The paper was titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20384599&#34;&gt;Antidepressant medication prevents suicide in depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Here&#39;s the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The finding that in-patient care for depression did not increase the probability of the detection of antidepressants in suicides is difficult to explain other than by the assumption that a substantial number of depressed individuals were saved from suicide by postdischarge treatment with antidepressant medication.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now I am having the same problem with the Paxil, and I really just want to get off the medication all together because I feel that it is causing the depression.  I was never depressed to begin with, but now I am!  After a couple of bad experiences with withdrawal symptoms from coming off the meds, I am really apprehensive about trying to taper off of them, but I want myself back, not this medicated, lethargic, irritable, unproductive person.  I was far from perfect, as my ex-husband made painfully clear, but I always had hope for a better future and energy to work for it.  I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that the meds have done more harm than good in my particular situation.  I just wonder if others have had similar experiences?  Thank you and best wishes in whatever you are searching for&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 18, Thomas Insel, MD, published an article on The World Economic Forum Blog.  The article is titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/01/four-things-leaders-need-to-know-about-mental-health/&#34;&gt;4 things leaders need to know about mental health&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/em&gt;Dr. Insel is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health.  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.weforum.org/world-economic-forum&#34;&gt;World Economic Forum&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;is an International Institution committed to improving the state of the world through public-private cooperation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Insel&amp;rsquo;s paper makes a number of assertions, some of which are misleading.  Here are some quotes, interspersed with my comments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After reading a few stories, I felt I had &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;to share my own. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;When I was in high school I was depressed. To the point where I was a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;walking text book definition. Failing grades, poor hygiene, isolation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;All the signs were obvious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;I had to go to rehab for drinking too much cough syrup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;When I went to the doctor he diagnosed me with ADHD. I have never been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;a hyper person. always rather slow and calm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;Than he tells me that he is going to just experiment with multiple &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;drugs to see what works, and than diagnose me with whatever that drug &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;treats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;First drug was Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;Its a new &amp;ldquo;abuse-free&amp;rdquo; amphetamine. Due to a coating of protein, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;chemical can only dissolve in your stomach acid. Injecting, Smoking, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;or Snorting would not activate it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;However the prescribed dose taken once a day was enough to make me a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;full effect of amphetamines, and I began losing alot of sleep. After &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;having multiple panic attacks on this medication, I demanded the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;doctor take me off of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;He than gave me Focalin (Dexmethylphenidate Hydrochloride)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;Another new &amp;ldquo;abuse-free&amp;rdquo; drug. During my younger years I experimented &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;with MDMA, and I would compare the feeling of Focalin with that of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;Extacy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;When I got into college my doctor pulled me off of it saying that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;college kids are more likely to sell it, and that he must change my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;prescription.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;Next drug was Strattera (atomoxetine). I threw up every time I took &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;it. It gave me intense piriods of happiness followed by extreme bursts &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;of anger for no reason at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;I stopped going to the doctor, I stopped taking medications. I no &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;longer trust the medical system, the pharm companies, or even the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;government. I&amp;rsquo;d rather suffer the depression untreated than go through &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;what I went through in high school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;On a side note, The experience made me drop out of school, and get my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;GED. That year, my school experienced a higher drop out rate than ever &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting article published on April 12, 2014 in Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732909&#34;&gt;The Efficacy of Antidepressants on Overall Well-Being and Self-Reported Depression Symptom Severity in Youth: A Meta-Analysis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; by Gary Spielmans and Katherine Gerwig, both of the Psychology Department, Metropolitan State University, St. Paul, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conducted a word-search in Medline, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register, and identified 8 studies that met their criteria.  They combined the data from these studies and concluded:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Professor Simon Wessely, who was recently installed as President of Britain&amp;rsquo;s Royal College of Psychiatrists, has just written his second post in that capacity.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/discoverpsychiatry/thepresidentsblog/happinessthegreatestgift.aspx&#34;&gt;Happiness: The greatest gift that I possess?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background to Dr. Wessely&amp;rsquo;s article is the recent launching of the UK&amp;rsquo;s Centre Forum&amp;rsquo;s Mental Health Commission&amp;rsquo;s report:  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.centreforum.org/assets/pubs/the-pursuit-of-happiness.pdf&#34;&gt;The pursuit of happiness:  a new ambition for our mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  This is a very interesting report, the gist of which can perhaps be gained from these quotes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 18, the British Medical Journal published an article by Christine Lu et al, titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3596&#34;&gt;Changes in antidepressant use by young people and suicidal behavior after FDA warnings and media coverage: quasi-experimental study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the conclusion paragraph from the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Safety warnings about antidepressants and widespread media coverage decreased antidepressant use, and there were simultaneous increases in suicide attempts among young people. It is essential to monitor and reduce possible unintended consequences of FDA warnings and media reporting.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the May 2014 issue of The Costco Connection, which is published by Costco Wholesale.  This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a copy of this magazine, and I would describe it as a catalog/lifestyle periodical. There are lots of ads for Costco&amp;rsquo;s own products, and the articles are wide ranging, topical, and easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular issue was drawn to my attention because on page 57, there&amp;rsquo;s an article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.costcoconnection.com/connection/201405?pg=60#pg60&#34;&gt;Blues Clues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  The subtitle is:  &amp;ldquo;Physical pain is one of the unexpected signs of depression.&amp;rdquo;   The author is Jodi Helmer, a freelance journalist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very important and compelling article was posted on Mad in America on June 18.  It&amp;rsquo;s by Andrew L. Yoder, and is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2014/06/open-letter-persons-self-identifying-mentally-ill/&#34;&gt;An Open Letter to Persons Self-Identifying as Mentally Ill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;My physician was not so cautious.  He was a very pleasant man that always seemed to take his time with me and did not talk down to me.  Yet as I described some of the emotional distress I was experiencing, and the ways it was affecting my life, he told me with great certainty that mine was a totally common experience.  He told me that I had a biological condition in my brain, one in which certain chemicals were &#39;imbalanced.&#39;  He told me that there should be no stigma about asking for assistance from him.  Specifically he told me, &#39;Trying to not be depressed is like telling a diabetic to just make more insulin.&#39;  He prescribed an antidepressant medication, saying that this was no different than taking medication to regulate blood pressure or manage cholesterol.  I was told of the likelihood that I would need to remain on some form of medication for an indefinite future.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alex Langford is a British trainee psychiatrist.  He blogs at The Psychiatric SHO, and on April 21, he posted an article titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://psychiatrysho.wordpress.com/2014/04/21/antidepressants-are-not-happy-pills/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antidepressants are not &amp;lsquo;happy pills.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://jeandavisonwriter.wordpress.com/2014/04/26/more-support-and-understanding-needed-for-people-wanting-to-try-a-no-meds-approach/&#34;&gt;Jean Davison&lt;/a&gt; for the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is an impassioned attack on psychiatry&amp;rsquo;s critics.  Here are some quotes, with my responses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;I am sick and tired of the way the press portrays depression as unhappiness and antidepressants as ‘happy pills’.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
This is interesting, though my general impression is that the mainstream media lean a good deal more towards psychiatry than towards our side of the debate.  In addition, the words &#34;depression&#34; and unhappiness are pretty much synonymous.  So it&#39;s difficult to see why that, or the characterization of antidepressants as &#34;happy pills,&#34; should be so upsetting to Dr. Langford.  We all, of course, have our linguistic likes and dislikes.  I personally don&#39;t care much for the growing trend to pronounce the indefinite article as &#34;ay,&#34; or for psychiatry&#39;s insistence on calling neuroleptic drugs &#34;anti-psychotics.&#34;  But what can you do?  I just Googled the phrase &#34;antidepressants are happy pills&#34; and got 204,000 hits!  So the notion has some traction and is probably here to stay.  One can&#39;t legislate for the way people use words.  Or perhaps psychiatrists imagine that they can.
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;For problems in other areas of health we’d only trust the experts to comment, but when it comes to mental health it seems like anyone can cast judgement.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;In June 2011, Rif El-Mallakh, MD, et al. published an article, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.toxicpsychiatry.com/storage/antidep%20El-Mallakh-tardivedysphoriadarticle1.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tardive dysphoria:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The role of long term antidepressant use in inducing chronic depression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in Medical Hypotheses.  The article is a thorough and wide-ranging study review.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Here are some quotes from the abstract:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;&#34;Treatment-resistant and chronic depression appear to be increasing.&#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;&#34;Depressed patients who ultimately become treatment resistant frequently have had a positive initial response to antidepressants and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;invariably&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; have received these agents for prolonged time periods at high doses.&#34; [Emphasis added]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DSM-5 - Dimensional Diagnoses - More Conflicts of Interest?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 20, JAMA Psychiatry (formerly Archives of General Psychiatry) published an interesting letter.  It was headed: &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=1780020&amp;amp;utm_source=Silverchair%20Information%20Systems&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=JAMAPsychiatry%3AOnlineFirst11%2F20%2F2013&#34;&gt;Failure to Report Financial Disclosure Information&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/i&gt; and was signed by Robert D. Gibbons PhD, David J Weiss PhD, Paul A. Pilkonis PhD, Ellen Frank, PhD , and David J. Kupfer MD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter is an apology for failing to disclose a financial interest in an article, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3551289/&#34;&gt;Development of a Computerized Adaptive Test for Depression&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; that had appeared in Archives of General Psychiatry a year earlier (November 2012).  The article described a computerized questionnaire for depression (the CAT-DI) and was generally positive with regards to the potential usefulness of the test in clinical settings.  In the article, the authors had clearly stated that they had &lt;i&gt;no conflicts of interest&lt;/i&gt;, but that:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depression Is Not An Illness:  A New Website</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-is-not-an-illness-a-new-website/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2013 06:01:25 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-is-not-an-illness-a-new-website/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently come across a new website that is challenging the illness approach to depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.depressionwars.com/fight-depression-blog.html&#34;&gt;depressionwars.com&lt;/a&gt; and is written by Char Leander, an industrial sociologist.  Char became interested in this topic when she saw &amp;ldquo;…the epidemic of emotional disorders in the workplace.&amp;rdquo;  She also recounts some personal experience with depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes from her November 11 post &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.depressionwars.com/fight-back-against-depression.html&#34;&gt;Fight Back Against Depression&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;You have to fight back against depression as disorder! The walls of depression may be high, but higher still are the invincible mental walls erected around the concepts of disorder, mental illness, and disease.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER VIDEO FROM DR. LIEBERMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 28, Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, President of the APA, made another video.  This one is titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/813056&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Important Look at Mortality in Mental Illness: A Decade of Data on Psychotropic Drugs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and was made for Medscape.  You can see the transcript at the same site.  Medscape is a web resource for medical practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is Dr. Lieberman&amp;rsquo;s commentary on an article that appeared in JAMA Psychiatry online on August 28:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1733743&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Comparative Mortality Risk in Adult Patients With Schizophrenia, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Participating in Psychopharmacology Clinical Trials&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Arif Khan, MD, et al.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dangers of SSRI&#39;s</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SSRI&amp;rsquo;S AND SUICIDE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Fiddaman has a post up today called &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiddaman.blogspot.com/2013/11/mhra-consultant-calls-for.html&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;MHRA Consultant Calls for Antidepressant Use in Young&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  The article highlights some of the dangers associated with SSRI&amp;rsquo;s, and also describes some of the attempts to suppress or discount the significance of this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently in 2010, Swedish psychiatrist Göran Isacsson, MD, PhD, published a paper in Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica.  The piece was titled &lt;i&gt;Antidepressant medication prevents suicide in depression,&lt;/i&gt; and reported that of a group of 1,077 depressed people who had committed suicide, only 15.2% had measurable amounts of antidepressants in the blood stream at the time of the suicide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Living-With-Parents Blues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the general rise in economic indicators over the past year or two, there are still many young adults who, for economic reasons, have had to move back in with their parents.  A proportion of these people become depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is the normal human reaction to loss, disappointment, or a general sense of unfulfillment.  Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that young people who have to move back in with their parents might be depressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, there was an interesting item in the Dear Abby column of our local newspaper.  Dear Abby is a general advice column written by Jeanne Phillips, and is widely read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter in question was written by &amp;ldquo;Sibling Standing By,&amp;rdquo; who described his/her 63 year old sister as someone who &amp;ldquo;…takes no responsibility for her health.&amp;rdquo; The sibling goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;She’s extremely overweight because she overeats and doesn’t exercise.  She complains every day that she feels &#39;terrible.&#39;  (I call it self-pitying whining.)&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently read a noteworthy article on PLOS One.  It&amp;rsquo;s by Joanne M. Dickson and Nicholas J. Moberly, and it&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0064512&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reduced Specificity of Personal Goals and Explanations for Goal Attainment in Major Depression&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting and detailed paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, who work at the University of Liverpool and the University of Exeter respectively, asked a group of depressed people and another group of people who were not depressed to list their goals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mid-Life Crisis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently on Twitter, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ambtax1&#34;&gt;Disparity&lt;/a&gt; asked for my opinion on the term mid-life crisis, which &amp;ldquo;…is often treated as a mental health condition.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term mid-life crisis has no formal meaning in mental health, though as Disparity says, the concept does emerge from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original meaning of the word &lt;em&gt;crisis&lt;/em&gt; was a turning point in an illness.  In the past forty of fifty years, the connotation has extended to embrace almost any kind of challenging situation or adverse event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Screening for Depression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Routine screening for depression sounds like a very good thing, and in fact it is recommended by NIMH, and by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (a division of the Department of Health and Human Services), and various other groups.  Medicare will pay the total cost of one depression screening per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it has long been suggested by those of us on this side of the debate that routine screenings, especially those &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; screenings that are paid for by pharmaceutical companies, have had a &lt;strong&gt;distinctive flavor of disease-mongering&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I keep two dictionaries on my desk.  The first is a 1964 Webster&amp;rsquo;s; the second is a 2009 Webster&amp;rsquo;s.  This morning I looked up the word &amp;ldquo;depression&amp;rdquo; in both books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1964:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;n. &lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt; a depressing or being depressed.  &lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt; a depressed part or place; hollow or low place.  &lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt; low spirits; dejection.  &lt;b&gt;4.&lt;/b&gt; a decrease in force, activity, amount, etc.  &lt;b&gt;5.&lt;/b&gt; a period marked by slackening of business activity, much unemployment, falling prices and wages, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new post on Mick Bramham&amp;rsquo;s website called &amp;ldquo;A time to grieve, a time to console, and a time to profit?&amp;rdquo;  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.mythsandrisks.info/2013/04/a-time-to-grieve-time-to-console-and.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have thought that, given the adverse publicity that pharma has been receiving in recent years, they would be easing up on their expansionist agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you would be wrong.  The &lt;strong&gt;APA has declared open season on bereavement&lt;/strong&gt;, and although DSM-5 won&amp;rsquo;t be released for a few more weeks, &lt;strong&gt;Eli Lilly is already grooming their SNRI Cymbalta as a &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; for this pseudo illness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an article in Science Daily (April 29, 2013) titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;Antidepressants Linked with Increased Risks After Surgery&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;rdquo; which I found courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter.  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130429164638.htm#.UX-m2v4zuaI.twitter&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  The article is a report of a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine.  You can see an abstract of the study &lt;a href=&#34;http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1682366&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by Andrew Auerbach MD et al, and involved examining the records of 530,416 patients who had undergone major surgery between January 2006 and December 2008 at 375 US hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More on Postpartum Depression</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-on-postpartum-depression/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 09:14:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-on-postpartum-depression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/24/postpartum-depression/&#34;&gt;post on postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt; which has generated a certain amount of negative comment.  For this reason, I thought it might be helpful to clarify some points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEFINITION AND EXPLANATIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSM makes no mention of postpartum depression as such.  The closest it comes is major depressive disorder with postpartum onset.  In other words, the APA conceptualizes postpartum depression as ordinary major depression (which can incidentally range in severity from mild to severe) which happens to occur in the postpartum period.  This is in marked contrast to the popular notion that postpartum depression is somehow a function of the postpartum woman&amp;rsquo;s hormones, and is fundamentally different from other forms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Postpartum Depression Not an Illness</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/postpartum-depression-not-an-illness/</link>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/postpartum-depression-not-an-illness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of the bio-psychiatric-pharma faction is to &lt;strong&gt;expand turf and sell more drugs&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is a multi-faceted endeavor, one component of which is disease mongering.  This consists of using marketing techniques to persuade large numbers of people that they have an illness which needs to be treated with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to postpartum depression, it is an obvious fact that some mothers do indeed experience a measure of depression in the period after giving birth.  The term postpartum depression has in the past been generally understood to mean that the problem had something to do with hormones.  Today brain chemicals are blamed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Power of Words to Shape Attitudes</title>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/the-power-of-words-to-shape-attitudes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post called:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/19/do-major-tranquilizers-make-things-worse/&#34;&gt;Do Major Tranquilizers Make Things Worse?&lt;/a&gt;  The post was based on a study by Drs. Harrow and Jobe in which they speculated that the high relapse rate of &amp;ldquo;schizophrenics&amp;rdquo; who stop taking their drugs may have more to do with drug &lt;i&gt;withdrawal&lt;/i&gt; than the supposed drug efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, at BeyondMeds, pointed out that these drugs should not be called tranquilizers because some of their effects (e.g. akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, etc.) are anything but tranquil.  And this, of course, is a good point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, courtesy of Talla Trialogue on Twitter, I have read an article by Shari Roan called &lt;i&gt;Blood Test for Depression Proves It&amp;rsquo;s Not All In Your Head&lt;/i&gt;.  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/01/25/major-depression-can-be-diagnosed-blood-test&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article appears to be an interview with Lonna Williams, the CEO of Ridge Diagnostics.  This company is reportedly introducing a blood test for depression.  The test is called MDDScore and is expected to cost $745.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article tells us that:  &amp;ldquo;You get a numerical score that suggests how likely it is that you have depression. Studies show that MDD Score is about as accurate at making a diagnosis as the most rigorous evaluations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Conflicts of Interest in Psychiatry</title>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-conflicts-of-interest-in-psychiatry/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come across an article by Lisa Cosgrove et al entitled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jep.12016/abstract&#34;&gt;Conflicts of interest and the quality of recommendations in clinical guidelines.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;It was published in the Journal of &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Evaluation in Clinical Practice in December of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everyone knows, the APA publishes the DSM, but they also publish &amp;ldquo;Clinical Practice Guidelines&amp;rdquo; for various &amp;ldquo;diagnoses,&amp;rdquo; including the condition known as major depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cosgrove and her colleagues examined the guidelines for major depression to see if the authors had financial or intellectual conflicts of interest.  An example of a financial conflict of interest would be recommending drug treatment when one is on the payroll of a drug company.  An example of an intellectual conflict of interest would be relying on and citing a poor quality study in support of a position in which one had a stake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shock &#34;Treatment&#34; Is Not Safe and Provides Little If Any Benefit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DELICATE THINGS REQUIRE DELICATE HANDLING&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, one of my hobbies was making small transistor radios.  It sounds complicated, but is well within the reach of an average 15-year-old.  You get some magazine articles, learn how to read a circuit, and learn how to use a soldering iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transistor is a small device – about half the size of a pencil eraser – with three wires coming out of it.  In building a radio receiver, the transistors have to be soldered to other devices which are in turn soldered to other devices, etc…  The soldering iron is plugged into a wall outlet, but no mains electricity reaches the tip of the iron.  However, tiny eddy currents can circulate in the tip, and although they are only of the order of &lt;i&gt;milliamps&lt;/i&gt;, they can burn a transistor in seconds.  What you have to do is unplug the iron from the socket, make the joint with the tip&amp;rsquo;s retained heat, and then replug the iron to have it ready for the next joint.  The point being that &lt;i&gt;delicate things require delicate handling&lt;/i&gt;, and that &lt;strong&gt;electricity can be very destructive&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 5, 2013, a bipartisan panel of leading mental health experts and parents of children with &amp;ldquo;mental disorders&amp;rdquo; held a conversation (that&amp;rsquo;s newspeak for meeting) in Washington D.C. on the topic: Violence and Severe Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invited panelists were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;Thomas Insel, MD, Director of NIMH
Harold Koplewicz, MD, President of Child Mind Institute
E. Fuller Torrey, MD, Founder of Treatment Advocacy Center
Michael Welner, MD, Founder and Chairman of The Forensic Panel
Michael Fitzpatrick, MSW, Director of NAMI
And three parents of &#34;diagnosed&#34; children&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/play-therapy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across an interesting article &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiddaman.blogspot.co.nz/2013/02/psychiatric-medication-or-play-therapy.html&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psychiatric Medication or Play Therapy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bob Fiddaman, a New Zealand writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article compares the efficacy and dangers of play therapy vs. pharmaceutical products for children with various problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;…play therapy outcome studies support the efficacy of this intervention with children suffering from various emotional and behavioral difficulties.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on marketing psychiatric medication.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Front groups that purport to fly the mental health flag are, in fact, nothing more than agents, pimps for the pharmaceutical industry.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about financial ties between pharmaceutical companies and psychiatrists.  Same old story; different location.  It&amp;rsquo;s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post was updated on March 22, 2015 to incorporate suggestions from a reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I was asked by an acquaintance for some &lt;strong&gt;suggestions for dealing with a bout of depression&lt;/strong&gt;.  As I was writing these out it occurred to me that the material might have some general interest, so I decided to publish it as a new post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have worked with a great many people who expressed concerns about dealing with depression.  These are the suggestions I gave these individuals which I believe were the most helpful: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>If Depression Is Not An Illness, What Is It?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2009/07/28/depression/#.URp1BKVEEeU&#34;&gt;Elsewhere on this site&lt;/a&gt;, I have argued that depression is not an illness, but rather is an&lt;strong&gt; adaptive mechanism that encourages us to make changes &lt;/strong&gt;in our habits or our circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written about what I call the seven natural anti-depressants:  good nutrition; fresh air; sunshine (in moderation); physical activity; purposeful activity; good relationships; and adequate and regular sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the question has often been posed:  Why does this adaptive mechanism apparently not work in some cases?  Why is it that for some people the unpleasant feeling fails to act as a spur to make changes, and instead the person sinks further into despondency and inactivity?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Depression is Not a Brain Defect</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-is-not-a-brain-defect/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2013 14:15:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/depression-is-not-a-brain-defect/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve come across an article by psychologist Bruce Levine, PhD, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2012/04/how-the-brain-defect-theory-of-depression-stigmatizes-depression-sufferers/&#34;&gt;How the “Brain Defect” Theory of Depression Stigmatizes Depression Sufferers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Levine convincingly debunks the brain defect theory, and also the notion that the illness theory destigmatizes depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; “Americans have been increasingly socialized to be terrified of the overwhelming pain that can fuel depression, and they have been taught to distrust their own and other’s ability to overcome it. This terror, like any terror, inhibits critical thinking. Without critical thinking, it is difficult to accurately assess the legitimacy of authorities. And Americans have become easy prey for mental health authorities’ proclamation that depression is a result of a brain defect.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry – The Sham Science</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/psychiatry-the-sham-science/</link>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/psychiatry-the-sham-science/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting article in last month’s issue of the British Journal of Psychiatry.  The article, titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5cLaT3gdm9NMTF2MVBfU1paOUk/edit&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychiatry beyond the current paradigm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was authored by Pat Bracken, an Irish psychiatrist, and 28 other British and Irish psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist of the piece is that the &lt;strong&gt;current psychiatric paradigm&lt;/strong&gt;, which the authors describe as “applied neuroscience,” is &lt;strong&gt;not supported by the evidence&lt;/strong&gt; and needs to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SSRI’s and Suicide Risk for Adolescents</title>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/ssri-s-and-suicide-risk-for-adolescents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This issue has been debated for years, but was finally considered to have been put to rest by NIMH’s 2004 Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS).  This study essentially “found” that fluoxetine (Prozac) was effective in treating depression and did not involve an increased risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Whitaker’s most recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mad-in-america/201202/the-real-suicide-data-the-tads-study-comes-light&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; points out that TADS actually found that adolescents treated with fluoxetine had a markedly higher risk for suicidal activity than those who received a placebo.  Robert also outlines the various statistical and methodological ploys that were used to conceal this finding and to sanitize the final report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More about Antidepressants and Placebos</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-about-antidepressants-and-placebos/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2012 10:39:26 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-about-antidepressants-and-placebos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The debate is over.  Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.  And yet the “depression-is-an-illness” lobby continues to grasp for straws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiona Godlee, editor of the British Medical Journal, recently cited “evidence” of the efficacy of antidepressants.  For a &lt;a href=&#34;http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2012/02/everybody-has-won-and-all-must-have.html&#34;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; of the Godlee article go to Duncan Double’s website “&lt;a href=&#34;http://criticalpsychiatry.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Critical Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise finding! - Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means in effect is that people are “curing” their own depression (gasp), and perhaps don’t really need the mental health practitioners (double gasp).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Blood Test for Depression</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/a-blood-test-for-depression/</link>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/a-blood-test-for-depression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Carlat in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://carlatpsychiatry.blogspot.com/2011/08/blood-test-for-depression-really.html&#34;&gt;blog post of August 15 &lt;/a&gt;mentions, and critiques, a so-called blood test for depression marketed (for $745) by Ridge Diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of Dr. Carlat’s criticism is that the test is not &lt;em&gt;predictive&lt;/em&gt; of depression, but merely enables one to tell (with some degree of accuracy) whether or not a person &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;depressed.  Dr. Carlat makes the point that you can tell this with more or less total accuracy simply by asking the person if he is depressed or by observing him for a few minutes of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-questionable-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Health (NIH) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  It is the primary U.S. Government agency responsible for medical research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH has 27 sub-departments, one of which is the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).  The NIMH has an annual budget of $1.5 billion, which they use to support research through grants and in-house work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago the NIMH approved a $35 million grant for the STAR*D study (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression).  The study was conducted  “…to determine the effectiveness of different treatments for people with major depression who have not responded to initial treatment with an antidepressant.”  This was to be the largest and longest study ever conducted to evaluate depression treatment, the results of which are now available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>An Interesting Post On Depression</title>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/an-interesting-post-on-depression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s some interesting reading at &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/04/06/frightening-story-behind-the-drug-companies-creation-of-medical-lobotomies.aspx&#34;&gt;Mercola.com&lt;/a&gt; posted April 6, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mercola states that depression is not an illness! - and that this bogus illness was created by psychiatrists and drug companies in order to sell drugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprises there for regular readers of this site.  Unfortunately Dr. Mercola doesn’t take the logic far enough.  Although he rightly debunks depression as an illness, he clings to the notion that other “mental illnesses” are bona fide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every society in every generation makes errors.  Some of the errors are minor.  Some are major.  One of the great errors of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century was this:  we accepted the spurious notion that a wide range of life’s problems were in fact &lt;em&gt;illnesses&lt;/em&gt;.  This spurious notion was initiated with good intentions – to provide shelter and humanitarian care for a relatively small number of individuals whose plight was truly dreadful.  But then the concept of mental illness took off, fuelled largely by the efforts of psychiatrists to legitimize their status as “real” doctors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drugs, Placebos, and Life</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/drugs-placebos-and-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2010 18:53:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/drugs-placebos-and-life/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have recently read a very interesting book by Irving Kirsch, PhD.  It’s called &lt;i&gt;The Emperor’s New Drugs&lt;/i&gt;, and the central theme of the work is that antidepressants are only very slightly more effective than placebos (i.e. sugar pills), and that the difference is not clinically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic is cogent and the research is rigorous.  Read the book and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirsch argues in favor of psychotherapy as a substitute for pills.  And certainly talking is usually helpful.  However, as long as depression is conceptualized as an illness, I don’t believe we will see real progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Post edited and updated March 9, 2013, to reflect additional thoughts as a result of interactions with the many people who left comments. I thank them for their input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEPRESSION – AN ADAPTIVE MECHANISM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the APA’s assertion, depression is not an illness. In fact, depression is an adaptive mechanism which has served humanity well for millions of years. When things are going well in our lives, we feel good. This good feeling is nature’s way of telling us to keep doing what we’re doing. When our lives are not going well, we feel down or depressed. This is nature’s way of telling us to make some changes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the anxiety disorders listed in DSM-IV is posttraumatic stress disorder. The criteria for this condition are listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;(1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others
(2) the person&#39;s response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Note: in children, this may be expressed instead by disorganized or agitated behavior&lt;/p&gt;</description>
