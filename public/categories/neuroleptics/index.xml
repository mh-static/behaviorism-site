      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an interesting story from Australia, recently back in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1962 to 1979, psychiatrist Harry Bailey, MD, serving as chief psychiatrist at Chelmsford Private Hospital in New South Wales, practiced &amp;ldquo;deep sleep therapy&amp;rdquo;, which involved keeping people in barbiturate-induced comas for days or even weeks.  Twenty-four of the individuals who received this &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo; died while still in the hospital.  Many more died or showed permanent brain damage after discharge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Allen Frances: Still Spinning the Story</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/allen-frances-still-spinning-the-story/</link>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/allen-frances-still-spinning-the-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 4, 2020, the very eminent Allen Frances, MD, published an article in Aeon, which according to its &lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/about&#34;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;a digital magazine, publishing some of the most profound and provocative thinking on the web. We ask the big questions and find the freshest, most original answers, provided by leading thinkers on science, philosophy, society and the arts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aeon.co/ideas/the-lure-of-cool-brain-research-is-stifling-psychotherapy&#34;&gt;The lure of ‘cool’ brain research is stifling psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  The central theme is that prior to 1990, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) &amp;ldquo;appreciated the need for a well-rounded approach [to mental health] and maintained a balanced research budget that covered an extraordinarily wide range of topics and techniques.&amp;rdquo;  However, since 1990, the opening year of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade_of_the_Brain&#34;&gt;Decade of the Brain&lt;/a&gt;, the NIMH has &amp;ldquo;increasingly narrowed its focus almost exclusively to brain biology – leaving out everything else that makes us human, both in sickness and in health.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Robert Whitaker Refutes Jeffrey Lieberman; But Is Psychiatry Reformable?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2017, Donald Goff, MD and seven other psychiatrists, including the very eminent Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, published an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry.  The title is: &lt;span style=&#34;color: #000080;&#34;&gt;&lt;span lang=&#34;zxx&#34;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.16091016&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Long-Term Effects of Antipsychotic Medication on Clinical Course in Schizophrenia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Concerns have been raised that treatment with antipsychotic medication might adversely affect long-term outcomes for people with schizophrenia. The evidence cited for these concerns includes the association of antipsychotic treatment with brain volume reduction and with dopamine receptor sensitization, which might make patients vulnerable to relapse and illness progression. An international group of experts was convened to examine findings from clinical and basic research relevant to these concerns. Little evidence was found to support a negative long-term effect of initial or maintenance antipsychotic treatment on outcomes, compared with withholding treatment. Randomized controlled trials strongly support the efficacy of antipsychotics for the acute treatment of psychosis and prevention of relapse; correlational evidence suggests that early intervention and reduced duration of untreated psychosis might improve longer-term outcomes. Strategies for treatment discontinuation or alternative nonpharmacologic treatment approaches may benefit a subgroup of patients but may be associated with incremental risk of relapse and require further study, including the development of biomarkers that will enable a precision medicine approach to individualized treatment.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Neuroleptic Drugs, Akathisia, and Suicide and Violence</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/neuroleptic-drugs-akathisia-and-suicide-and-violence/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2016 05:30:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/neuroleptic-drugs-akathisia-and-suicide-and-violence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thirty-three years ago, in August 1983, an article titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Suicide-Associated-with-Akathisia-and-Depot-Fluphenzaine-Treatment-KShear-1983.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Associated with Akathisia and Depot Fluphenazine Treatment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology.  The authors were Katherine Shear, MD, Allen Frances, MD, and Peter Weiden, MD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes, interspersed with my comments/observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Akathisia is a common and distressing side effect of neuroleptic medication that can be difficult to recognize and treat.  Several previous reports mention maladaptive behavioral consequences, such as poor compliance with prescribed medication and aggressive or self-destructive outbursts.  We are reporting suicides in two young Hispanic men who had developed severe akathisia after treatment with depot fluphenazine.  Depression with suicidal behavior has been observed following fluphenazine injection, but suicide associated with akathisia has not been previously noted.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/allen-frances-on-the-benefits-of-antipsychotics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On February 1, Allen Frances, MD, published an interesting article on the Huffington Post blog.  The article is called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/do-antipsychotics-help-or_b_9131376.html&#34;&gt;Do Antipsychotics Help or Harm Psychotic Symptoms?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and is a response to Robert Whitaker&amp;rsquo;s post of January 27:  &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2016/01/me-allen-frances-and-climbing-out-of-a-pigeonhole/&#34;&gt;Me, Allen Frances, and Climbing Out of a Pigeonhole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  This post, in turn, was a response to Dr. Frances&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-frances/psychiatric-medicines-are_b_8990770.html&#34;&gt;Psychiatric Medicines Are Not All Good or All Bad&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which was published in the Huffington Post on January 15.  Readers may remember that I published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2016/02/09/allen-frances-seeks-the-middle-way/&#34;&gt;critique&lt;/a&gt; of this latter article on February 9.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 19, 2015, I published a post titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2015/06/19/allen-frances-ties-to-johnson-and-johnson/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allen Frances&amp;rsquo; Ties to Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In that post, I set out some very serious allegations against Dr. Frances.  I drew these allegations from a document titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rothman.pdf&#34;&gt;Special Witness Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; dated October 15, 2010.  The report was written by David Rothman, PhD, Professor of Social Medicine at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rothman&amp;rsquo;s report was produced in the context of a lawsuit filed by the State of Texas against Janssen Pharmaceutica, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across an article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://uottawa.scholarsportal.info/ottawa/index.php/aporia/article/view/3486/3195&#34;&gt;Diagnosisgate: Conflict of Interest at the Top of the Psychiatric Apparatus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Paula Caplan, PhD.  The article was published in Aporia, the University of Ottawa nursing journal, in January 2015.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oa.uottawa.ca/journals/aporia/about_aporia.jsp?lang=&#34;&gt;Aporia&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;a peer-reviewed, bilingual, and open access journal dedicated to scholarly debates in nursing and the health sciences.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr, Caplan is a clinical and research psychologist, and an Associate at Harvard&amp;rsquo;s DuBois Institute.  She worked as a consultant to the DSM-IV task force in the 1980&amp;rsquo;s, but resigned from this position after two years.    Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote from her February 2014 post on Mad in America &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2014/02/great-crazy-cover-harm-results-rewriting-history-dsm/&#34;&gt;The Great “Crazy” Cover-up: Harm Results from Rewriting the History of DSM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Neuroleptic Drugs And Mortality</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/neuroleptic-drugs-and-mortality/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2015 05:30:18 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/neuroleptic-drugs-and-mortality/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November of last year, the Schizophrenia Bulletin published online a research study:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25422511&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antipsychotic Treatment and Mortality in Schizophrenia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Minna Torniainen et al.  The research was conducted in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors offer the following background for the study:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;It is generally believed that long-term use of antipsychotics increases mortality and, especially, the risk of cardiovascular death. However, there are no solid data to substantiate this view.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
and the following conclusions:
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Among patients with schizophrenia, the cumulative antipsychotic exposure displays a U-shaped curve for overall mortality, revealing the highest risk of death among those patients with no antipsychotic use. These results indicate that both excess overall and cardiovascular mortality in schizophrenia is attributable to other factors than antipsychotic treatment when used in adequate dosages.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Drugging of Children in Foster Care</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no secret that here in America, foster children are being prescribed psychiatric drugs, especially neuroleptics, as a means of controlling their behavior.  A great deal has been said and written on the matter.  Politicians have declared the practice deplorable.  Children&#39;s advocacy groups have expressed concern, and, of course, those of us in the antipsychiatry movement have screamed till we&#39;re hoarse.  But the problem persists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past six months or so, the San Jose Mercury News, a California newspaper, has been running frequent articles on this topic, calling for oversight and corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thomas Insel:  &#34;Are Children Overmedicated?&#34;</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/thomas-insel-are-children-overmedicated/</link>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/thomas-insel-are-children-overmedicated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thomas Insel, MD, is the Director of the National Institute of Mental Health.  In June of last year, he published, on the Director&amp;rsquo;s Blog, an article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2014/are-children-overmedicated.shtml&#34;&gt;Are Children Overmedicated?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;  The gist of the article is that children are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being overmedicated, but rather that there is an increase in &amp;ldquo;severe psychiatric problems&amp;rdquo; in this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes, interspersed with my comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The latest estimate from the National Center for Health Statistics reports that 7.5 percent of U.S. children between ages 6 and 17 were taking medication for &#39;emotional or behavioral difficulties&#39; in 2011-2012. The CDC reports a five-fold increase in the number of children under 18 on psychostimulants from 1988-1994 to 2007–2010, with the most recent rate of 4.2 percent. The same report estimates that 1.3 percent of children are on antidepressants. The rate of antipsychotic prescriptions for children has increased six-fold over this same period, according to a study of office visits within the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. In children under age 5, psychotropic prescription rates peaked at 1.45 percent in 2002-2005 and declined to 1.00 percent from 2006-2009.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On August 19, 2014, the Annals of Internal Medicine published a paper titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25133360&#34;&gt;Atypical Antipsychotic Drugs and the Risk for Acute Kidney Injury [AKI] and Other Adverse Outcomes in Older Adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  The authors were Joseph Hwang et al, and the study was conducted at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Ontario, Canada.  The primary funding source was the Academic Medical Organization of Southwestern Ontario.  The principal investigator was Amit X. Garg, MD, PhD, a kidney specialist at the London Health Science Center and the London Kidney Clinical Research Unit in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Use of Neuroleptic Drugs as Chemical Restraints</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 17, I wrote a post on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2014/07/use-neuroleptic-drugs-chemical-restraints-nursing-homes/&#34;&gt;use of neuroleptic drugs as chemical restraints in nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;.  The article generated some comments, one of which touched on some very fundamental issues which, in my view, warrant further discussion.  The comment was from drsusanmolchan and read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;All drugs can be dangerous toxic chemicals when not used appropriately. While many valid points are made in this article, it’s very one-sided and could be considered biased in that it’s written by a psychologist. I’ve seen many patients and families benefit from their use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article in the July-August 2014 issue of the AARP Bulletin.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aarp.org/health/drugs-supplements/info-2014/antipsychotics-overprescribed.html&#34;&gt;Drug Abuse: Antipsychotics in Nursing Homes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and was written by Jan Goodwin.  AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons.   Jan Goodwin is an investigative journalist whose career, according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Goodwin&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;…has been committed to focusing attention on social justice and human rights…&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is essentially a condemnation of the widespread and long-standing practice of using neuroleptic drugs to suppress &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo; behavior in nursing home residents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;However, tacked onto the bill was a rider which authorized $60 million to &lt;i&gt;expand&lt;/i&gt; involuntary outpatient commitment (IOC) in states that already have provision for commitments of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting February 11, 2014, article on Peter Breggin&amp;rsquo;s website:  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://breggin.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=308&#34;&gt;$1.5 Million Award in Child Tardive Dyskinesia Malpractice&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/i&gt;Thanks to Mad in America for the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the opening paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;On February 11, 2014 a Chicago jury awarded $1.5 million to an autistic child who developed a severe case of tardive dyskinesia and tardive akathisia while being treated by psychiatrists with Risperdal and then Zyprexa between 2002 and 2007. The drug-induced disorder was diagnosed when he was fifteen years old and by then had become disabling and irreversible.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;I recently read &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/4236/appi.ajp.2011.11010039.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;The NIMH-CATIE Schizophrenia Study: What Did We Learn?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; by Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, and T. Scott Stroup, MD, MPH.  The article was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry 168:8, August 2011.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;When the CATIE study was designed in 1999-2000, the prevailing opinion of researchers and clinicians alike was that the newer (second-generation) antipsychotic drugs were vastly superior to the older (first-generation) antipsychotic drugs in efficacy and safety. This largely reflected the results of studies sponsored by the manufacturers of the new drugs…, marketing messages of pharmaceutical companies and the hopes of many who wanted better treatments.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;In November, Joanna Moncrieff, MD, a British psychiatrist who works as a Senior Lecturer in psychiatry at University College London and a practicing consultant psychiatrist, started &lt;a href=&#34;http://joannamoncrieff.com/blog/&#34;&gt;her own blog&lt;/a&gt;.  What&amp;rsquo;s remarkable about this blog is that it is highly critical of psychiatry.  Dr. Moncrieff marshals important facts and arguments in this area, and it is probably safe to say that her popularity among her peers is in decline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts that she adduces, however, are indisputable, and her qualities of honesty, courage, and integrity are evident in everything she writes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CAFÉ Study: Real Science or Marketing Exercise?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 8,  I received the following &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/12/06/u-of-minnesota-faculty-senate-vote-to-review-dan-markingsons-death/&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from a reader:  (The subject matter is the controversial CAFÉ – Comparisons of Atypicals in First Episode of Psychosis - study.  This was the study in which Dan Markingson committed suicide.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;It appears that there was no head-to-head with a control group taking a placebo pill. Nor was there a control group featuring &#39;old&#39; types of &#39;antipsychotic&#39;. If that was the case then it is very poor study. If you are just looking at 3 &#39;new&#39; subtypes of a &#39;new&#39; class - then what on earth can you hope to show from the data.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2012, Mark Olfson, MD, et al, published an article in the Archives of General Psychiatry.  The title is &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22868273&#34;&gt;National Trends in the Office-Based Treatment of Children, Adolescents, and Adults with Antipsychotics&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/i&gt;The authors collected data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys for the period 1993-2009, and looked for trends in antipsychotic prescribing for children, adolescents, and adults in outpatient visits.  Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;&lt;!--
table { 	border: 1px solid gray;     	border-collapse: collapse;      	width: 500px;   	cellspacing: 0; } th {     	background-color: #eee;          border: 1px solid black; }  th#blank {     	background- color: #FFF;  }  th.colOne {         width: 100px; } td {     	text-align: center;  	border: 1px solid black; } table#diagnosis th.data {         width: 120px; }
--&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table id=&#34;antipsychoticRX&#34; cellspacing=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;colOne&#34;&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Increase in no. of antipsychotic prescriptions per 100 population (1993-2009)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;0-13&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.24-1.83 (almost 8-fold)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;14-20&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0.78-3.76 (almost 5-fold)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;21+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.25-6.18 (almost 2-fold)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;The authors provide a breakdown of the diagnoses assigned to the children and adolescents during the antipsychotic visits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER VIDEO FROM DR. LIEBERMAN&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 28, Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, President of the APA, made another video.  This one is titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/813056&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Important Look at Mortality in Mental Illness: A Decade of Data on Psychotropic Drugs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and was made for Medscape.  You can see the transcript at the same site.  Medscape is a web resource for medical practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is Dr. Lieberman&amp;rsquo;s commentary on an article that appeared in JAMA Psychiatry online on August 28:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1733743&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Comparative Mortality Risk in Adult Patients With Schizophrenia, Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety Disorders, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Participating in Psychopharmacology Clinical Trials&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Arif Khan, MD, et al.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading another great book:  &lt;i&gt;Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime: How big pharma has corrupted healthcare&lt;/i&gt;, by Peter C. Gotzsche [Radcliffe Publishing, 2013].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is an exposé of pharma&amp;rsquo;s fraudulent research and marketing.  The author is a Danish physician who has been involved in clinical trials of drugs, and in drug regulatory matters.  He is a professor at the University of Copenhagen.  He has published more than 50 papers, including papers in the BMJ, Lancet, JAMA, Annals of Internal Medicine, and the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article on Harvard Law Petrie-Flom Center&amp;rsquo;s blog titled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2013/09/19/daubert-as-a-problem-for-psychiatrists/&#34;&gt;Daubert as a Problem for Psychiatrists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;  It was written by Alex Stein and is dated September 19.  [Thanks to Dustin Salzedo for drawing my attention to this in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/09/24/ssris-impair-learning/&#34;&gt;comment on an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article deals with the legal rules governing the admission of expert testimony.  Apparently there are two different sets of rules in this area, known respectively as Frye and Daubert.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Submitting Claims for Off-label Prescriptions to Medicaid May Constitute Fraud</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/submitting-claims-for-off-label-prescriptions-to-medicaid-may-constitute-fraud/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2013 08:03:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/submitting-claims-for-off-label-prescriptions-to-medicaid-may-constitute-fraud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my view, one of the most destructive developments in psychiatry in recent years is the &lt;strong&gt;prescribing of neuroleptic drugs to children&lt;/strong&gt;.  Much of this prescribing is off-label, meaning that the prescribed use is not approved by the FDA.  Off-label drug prescribing is &lt;i&gt;legal&lt;/i&gt;, however.  Once the FDA has approved a drug for one purpose, a physician may prescribe it for &lt;i&gt;another &lt;/i&gt;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i&gt;under Medicaid rules&lt;/i&gt;, the physician is not permitted to bill Medicaid for writing this prescription unless the use of the drug in the specific circumstances is endorsed by any of the three pharmaceutical compendia approved by Congress for this purpose.  A physician who deliberately submits a bill to Medicaid and, thereby, effectively causes Medicaid to pay for, a prescription that is both off-label &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; unapproved by any of the compendia &lt;strong&gt;is open to a charge of Medicaid fraud&lt;/strong&gt;.  Medicaid, incidentally, is the US government&amp;rsquo;s health insurance system for poor people.  Eligibility is based on income.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do Psycho-Pharma Drugs Have Any Legitimate Function?</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/do-psycho-pharma-drugs-have-any-legitimate-function/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last ten years or so, the anti-psychiatry movement has been gaining adherents, and has been growing more focused and more outspoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are not a unified group.  I, for instance, take what I think would be considered a fairly extreme position.  I believe that there are no mental illnesses; that the clusters of thoughts, feelings, and actions labeled as mental illnesses are better conceptualized as habits that have been acquired in accordance with the normal principles of behavior acquisition or as understandable responses to extreme life stressors.  I further believe that conceptualizing these problems as illnesses has been disastrous for the individuals involved, and for society in general.  In particular, I believe that psychiatry&amp;rsquo;s promotion of the idea that all problematic thinking, feeling, and behaving is caused by brain illnesses and can only be treated with drugs is causing extraordinary levels of physical damage to their clients.  It is also severely stigmatizing and disempowering.  As a culture, we are losing the notion that people can improve their lives through effort and application, and through mutual assistance and support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned the CATIE study &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/07/16/the-cafe-study-dr-liebermans-high-moral-ground/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;.  CATIE (Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness) was a NIMH-funded double blinded, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness and side effects of newer-generation neuroleptics versus an older neuroleptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CATIE-AD.pdf&#34;&gt;CATIE-AD&lt;/a&gt; was a part of CATIE.  The AD stands for Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease.  CATIE-AD was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2006.  The results of the study were as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;There were no significant differences among treatments with regard to the time to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Are The Second Generation Neuroleptics Good For the Brain?</title>

      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/are-the-second-generation-neuroleptics-good-for-the-brain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an editorial by Henry Nasrallah, MD, in last month&amp;rsquo;s edition of &lt;em&gt;Current Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.  Dr. Nasrallah is the journal&amp;rsquo;s editor-in-chief.  The title of the article is &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/uploads/media/007_0713CP_FromTheEditor_FINAL.pdf&#34;&gt;Haloperidol clearly is neurotoxic.  Should it be banned?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt; Haloperidol is marketed under the brand name Haldol, but its patent has long expired, and a generic version is available and inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote from Dr. Nasrallah&amp;rsquo;s article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;If clinicians who use these decades old drugs were to keep up with medical research and advances in knowledge, we would realize what a travesty it is to use a brain-unfriendly drug such as haloperidol when we have many safer alternatives. A massive volume of knowledge has emerged over the past 15 years about the neurotoxicity of older neuroleptics, especially haloperidol—knowledge that was completely unknown before.   Second-generation antipsychotics have been shown to be much safer for the brain than their older-generation counterparts (although they are not more efficacious).&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sandra Steingard, MD, is a practicing psychiatrist who from time to time posts articles on Robert Whitaker&amp;rsquo;s Mad in America website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Steingard apparently prescribes psychotropic drugs in her practice, but she is by no means a pill-for-every-problem practitioner, and her articles are always interesting and thought-provoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Steingard posted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/07/a-paradox-revealed-again/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Paradox Revealed – Again&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Mad in America on July 7, 2013.  In this article she mentions the recent study by Lex Wunderink et al, which found that people being treated for first episode psychosis were doing a great deal better functionally after seven years if their neuroleptic drugs had been discontinued or reduced relatively early in the process, as compared to individuals who were retained on the drugs for two years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAFE Study, conducted by Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, et al between 2002 and 2005, has been the subject of much comment.  Carl Elliott, in particular, has written extensively on the matter, including his article &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/dan-markingson-drug-trial-astrazeneca?page=1&#34;&gt;The Deadly Corruption of Clinical Trials&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in Mother Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to address the issues involved in the CAFE study, we must first take a brief look at the CATIE study.  This was also conducted by Dr. Lieberman et al (not the same et al as CAFE, but with some overlap).  CATIE was conducted between 2001 and 2004.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess everybody knows by now that Robert Whitaker spoke at the NAMI conference in San Antonio last Saturday (June 29).   You can view an outline of his speech, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nami.org/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm?ContentFileID=200482&amp;amp;MicrositeID=0&amp;amp;FusePreview=Yes&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Case for Selective Use of &lt;/i&gt;Antipsychotics here&lt;/a&gt;.  He spoke about the fact that for people who have been assigned a &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;schizophrenia,&amp;rdquo; long-term outcomes are better among those who took relatively &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; of neuroleptic drugs, and worse among those who took relatively &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a central theme of this website that psychiatry has done, and continues to do, a great deal of damage to people it claims to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the damage done by neuroleptic drugs is among the most severe.  The increasing use of these products ought to be a huge cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;i&gt;particularly&lt;/i&gt; true in that &lt;strong&gt;these very toxic drugs are being administered with increasing frequency to &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; – even to children as young as two years old!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, The American Society of Consultant Pharmacists published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ascp.com/articles/antipsychotic-medication-use-nursing-facility-residents&#34;&gt;report on the use of neuroleptic drugs in nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;.  According to this report, 25% of nursing home residents receive neuroleptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) consider these prescriptions appropriate only if the recipient is psychotic.  (Obviously we could discuss this at length, but let&amp;rsquo;s set that issue aside for now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What CMS considers entirely &lt;i&gt;inappropriate&lt;/i&gt;, however, is prescribing these products to residents with dementia as a way of controlling &amp;ldquo;difficult&amp;rdquo; behaviors such as wandering, being abusive, or resisting care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akathisia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Melissa, a commenter on a recent post, asked if I would do a post on akathisia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akathisia literally means inability to sit.  People with this problem typically pace for long periods, and if they do sit down, they continue to keep moving and shifting their position in the chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In severity it can range from a generalized sense of uneasiness or agitation, to severe discomfort and even pain.  The discomfort tends to be located in the legs, but can also occur in the hip and pelvic area.  In severe cases, the victims pace to the point of exhaustion, but even then sitting does not relieve the discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yobluemama2&#34;&gt;yobluemama2&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across an interesting article.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://psychrights.org/articles/081130JanneLarssonpsychiatricdrugssuicide.pdf&#34;&gt;Psychiatric Drugs and Suicide&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; by Janne Larsson, a reporter.  It&amp;rsquo;s posted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://psychrights.org/index.htm&#34;&gt;PsychRights.org&lt;/a&gt;, a law project for psychiatric rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on suicides committed in Sweden in 2006-2007, and the proportions of victims who had taken psychiatric drugs in the period prior to the suicide.  The study also covers data from autopsy reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information for the study was gathered under Sweden&amp;rsquo;s freedom of information act.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the main findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Neuroleptics for Children</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of all the evils perpetrated by American psychiatry in the past 60 years, the administration of neuroleptic drugs to children is arguably the worst.  And it is a practice that is growing each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential purpose of these drugs is to make people more docile and more easily managed by &lt;strong&gt;destroying brain tissue&lt;/strong&gt;.  The side effects are devastating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently Gabrielle Carson, MD, a psychiatrist at Stony Brook Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital, wrote a paper on &lt;i&gt;The Dramatic Rise in Neuroleptic Use In Children: Why Do We Do It and What Does It Buy Us?&lt;/i&gt;  You can see Dr. Carlson&amp;rsquo;s commentary &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/carlson-on-neuroleptics_aaps.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  (Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yobluemama2&#34;&gt;yobluemama2&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for flagging the article.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Talk Therapy for Schizophrenia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article on Vermont&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;Seven Days&lt;/i&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;i&gt;Burlington&amp;rsquo;s HowardCenter Tries a New Approach to Treating Mental Illness: More Talk, Fewer Meds.&lt;/i&gt;  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.7dvt.com/2013burlingtons-howardcenter-tries-new-approach-treating-mental-illness-more-talking-fewer-meds&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  (Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Steven_Coles_&#34;&gt;Steven Coles&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter for the link.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Vermont&amp;rsquo;s Department of Mental Health is promoting a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; kind of treatment for psychosis:  talk therapy.  The project leader is Dr. Sandra Steingard, who for most of her career accepted the orthodox view of schizophrenia and the need for neuroleptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;You must take these pills for life.&#34;  Or is it for death?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an important article (&lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/2013/05/07/interview-john-nash/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) on Monica Cassani&amp;rsquo;s website &lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/&#34;&gt;BeyondMeds&lt;/a&gt; in which she tackles the myth that once a person has been assigned a &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; of schizophrenia, he/she must take neuroleptics for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Unfortunately, at this juncture in history many people who get labeled with psychiatric illness these days do not have the opportunity for recovery because they are encouraged to stay ill by a system that all too often impedes psychological growth by use of excessive psychotropic drugs. This over-use of medication also kills people. The average life-span of people taking these medications is 25 years shorter than people who do not take these drugs. The drugs cause a long laundry list of problems only some of which are diabetes, obesity, heart conditions and a shrinking brain.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Neuroleptics Increase the Risk of Osteoporosis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all known for a long time that neuroleptic drugs damage brain cells.  But now it seems clear that they also &lt;strong&gt;increase the risk of osteoporosis and consequently bone fractures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an article about this in the International Journal of Endocrinology, dated March 2013.  It&amp;rsquo;s titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Osteoporosis-Associated-with-Antipsychotic-Treatment-in-Schizophrenia.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Osteoporosis Associated with Antipsychotic Treatment in Schizophrenia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and was written by Haishan Wu et al, from the Central South University in Changsha, China.  I came upon the article through Robert Whitaker&amp;rsquo;s site &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Power of Words to Shape Attitudes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post called:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/19/do-major-tranquilizers-make-things-worse/&#34;&gt;Do Major Tranquilizers Make Things Worse?&lt;/a&gt;  The post was based on a study by Drs. Harrow and Jobe in which they speculated that the high relapse rate of &amp;ldquo;schizophrenics&amp;rdquo; who stop taking their drugs may have more to do with drug &lt;i&gt;withdrawal&lt;/i&gt; than the supposed drug efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, at BeyondMeds, pointed out that these drugs should not be called tranquilizers because some of their effects (e.g. akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, etc.) are anything but tranquil.  And this, of course, is a good point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the late 80&amp;rsquo;s, I worked for a while in an addictions unit that was located on the grounds of a State Hospital in West Virginia.  Clients would arrive on 72-hour holding committals from the counties, and if the psychiatrist felt that the client needed to stay longer than that (which was almost always the case), then either the client had to convert to voluntary status, which is what happened in most cases, or the hospital had to arrange for a hearing in front of a judge.  For convenience, a local judge would come in and the hearing would be held in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
