      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thirty-three years ago, in August 1983, an article titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Suicide-Associated-with-Akathisia-and-Depot-Fluphenzaine-Treatment-KShear-1983.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Associated with Akathisia and Depot Fluphenazine Treatment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology.  The authors were Katherine Shear, MD, Allen Frances, MD, and Peter Weiden, MD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes, interspersed with my comments/observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Akathisia is a common and distressing side effect of neuroleptic medication that can be difficult to recognize and treat.  Several previous reports mention maladaptive behavioral consequences, such as poor compliance with prescribed medication and aggressive or self-destructive outbursts.  We are reporting suicides in two young Hispanic men who had developed severe akathisia after treatment with depot fluphenazine.  Depression with suicidal behavior has been observed following fluphenazine injection, but suicide associated with akathisia has not been previously noted.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On September 28, US Senator John McCain (R-AZ) introduced a bill in the Senate titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s3410/text&#34;&gt;Veteran Overmedication Prevention Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (S. 3410).  This is a companion bill to HR 4640, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4640/text&#34;&gt;Veteran Suicide Prevention Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; introduced in the House by Congressman David Jolly (R-FL) earlier this year.  The objective of both bills is to combat suicide deaths by ensuring that accurate information is available on the relationship between suicides and prescription &amp;ldquo;medication&amp;rdquo;.  At the present time, 20 US veterans a day are dying by suicide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica published a study by Göran Isacsson et al.  The paper was titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20384599&#34;&gt;Antidepressant medication prevents suicide in depression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.  Here&#39;s the conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The finding that in-patient care for depression did not increase the probability of the detection of antidepressants in suicides is difficult to explain other than by the assumption that a substantial number of depressed individuals were saved from suicide by postdischarge treatment with antidepressant medication.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Findling, MD, is a pediatrician and a psychiatrist.  He is the Director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Children&amp;rsquo;s Center, and Vice President of Psychiatric Services and Research at the Kennedy Krieger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 31, Dr. Findling published a brief video (and article) on Medscape:  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/828984&#34;&gt;Adverse Events Caused by a Drug Warning?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Findling&amp;rsquo;s article is essentially a commentary on a study by Christine Lu et al, which was published by the BMJ on June 18.  Here is the conclusion paragraph from the Lu et al report:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Suicidal Behavior After FDA Warnings</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/suicidal-behavior-after-fda-warnings/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 18, the British Medical Journal published an article by Christine Lu et al, titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3596&#34;&gt;Changes in antidepressant use by young people and suicidal behavior after FDA warnings and media coverage: quasi-experimental study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the conclusion paragraph from the abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Safety warnings about antidepressants and widespread media coverage decreased antidepressant use, and there were simultaneous increases in suicide attempts among young people. It is essential to monitor and reduce possible unintended consequences of FDA warnings and media reporting.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;My Story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft size-full wp-image-1519&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/tell-your-story.png&#34; alt=&#34;This post was submitted by a reader.&#34; width=&#34;247&#34; height=&#34;209&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;I tried to commit suicide for the first time when I was 15. I spent my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;16th birthday locked up in Dammasch State Mental Hospital, I freaked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;out when I was told I was going to have to stay so my clothes were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;ripped off me, by male aids and I was thrown naked in a real padded &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;room&amp;hellip; hint they are NOT padded. The light was on all the time and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;nothing was provided for cover to keep warm. I remember seeing men &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;looking at me and I remember pictures being taken thru the peek hole &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;window. I was in that room, with meals shoved thru a slit in the door &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;for 3 days. The toilet was a hole in the floor and no, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;any toilet paper. . While at the &amp;ldquo;hospital&amp;rdquo;, I remember being put in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;strait jacket and tied into a chair and my &amp;ldquo;meds&amp;rdquo; forced down my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;throat. When I realized I could vomit them back up I was sedated and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;given drugs via an IV. I woke up to being raped. I made friends with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;one gal, she was 14. She had ( I know know as ) anorexia. I watched &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;her try and try and try to eat. She died. Another person I made &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;friends with hung himself and died. The psy dr said I was on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;schedule for shock treatments since I refused to co-operate with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;rules and the staff. That scared the shit outta me. I started doing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;all the things I was supposed to do and 3 months later I was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;released.. cured. Nothing was different for me, except I learned how &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;to manipulate people to get what I wanted. I HATED that feeling so I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;never took &amp;ldquo;advantage&amp;rdquo; of that &amp;ldquo;skill&amp;rdquo;.. Remember I had just turned &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;16.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;In my early 20&amp;rsquo;s I tried to commit suicide again and committed to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;another hosp in Vancouver WA with a DX of Manic Depression. I was on a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;cocktail of lithium, stelazine, tofranil chloral hydrate and a few &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;others I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the names of .. for more than 7 years I saw a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;psychiatrist until my divorce and my insurance ran out. Dumped to fare &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;the best I could into the mental health system for the poor I quit all &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;my drugs cold turkey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34; /&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;It was while under the Dr&amp;rsquo;s care I read a book he recommended called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;Self-Talk. I believed I was sick with metal illness(es?) until I read &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;that book. For the first time I heard no one can make me feel anyway &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;at all unless I choose to let them. That my responses to life were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;totally under my control and direction ALL of them. I was 32. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve attempted suicide or came very very close to it 6 times in my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;life. Finally I asked myself, self, I&amp;rsquo;m smart enough to have gotten &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;the job done so whats REALLY going on? I figured out WHY I kept diving &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;into the back hole. I really do walk a different, road now thanks to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;getting the message my subconscious kept sending me. Thats been my &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;experience with the Mental Health system. I am continually agast and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;appalled at the amount of drugs being forced onto people, particularly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;children, We adults have been fed a line of BS for so long about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #222222;&#34;&gt;depression that it&amp;rsquo;s destroying us as a nation and no one can see it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;There was an interesting article, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cphpost.dk/news/antidepressant-regulations-tightened-following-suicide.8243.html&#34;&gt;Antidepressant regulations tightened following suicide&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; in the Copenhagen Post on January 7.  Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2014/01/denmark-hold-psychiatrist-responsible-suicide-restrict-antidepressants/&#34;&gt;Mad in America&lt;/a&gt; for the link. It is reported that Danilo Terrida, aged 20, committed suicide in 2011 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;&#34;…eleven days after he was prescribed antidepressants following an eight-minute-long conversation with a doctor.&#34;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;The doctor has been deemed responsible for the suicide by the National Agency for Patients&#39; Rights and Complaints.  According to its website:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The National Agency for Patients&#39; Rights and Complaints functions as a single point of access for patients who wish to complain about the professional treatment in the Danish health service.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;On December 27, 2013, Connecticut State Police issued a 7,000-page, heavily redacted, report on the massacre that occurred at Sandy Hook Elementary School just over a year earlier (December 14, 2012).  For the record, I have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt; read the 7,000-page report, but I have read the Wikipedia article &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting&#34;&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;, last updated January 4, 2013, and several media reports on the matter, including reports from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/nyregion/with-release-of-final-sandy-hook-shooting-report-investigation-is-said-to-be-over.html?hpw&amp;amp;rref=nyregion&amp;amp;_r=0&#34;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.courant.com/2013-12-28/news/hc-lanza-sandy-hook-report1228-20131227_1_peter-lanza-adam-lanza-nancy-lanza&#34;&gt;Hartford Courant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/police-file-to-be-released-on-newtown-shooting/2013/12/27/36612944-6ec5-11e3-a5d0-6f31cd74f760_story.html&#34;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CAFÉ Study: Real Science or Marketing Exercise?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/caf%C3%A9-study-real-science-or-marketing-exercise/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 8,  I received the following &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/12/06/u-of-minnesota-faculty-senate-vote-to-review-dan-markingsons-death/&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; from a reader:  (The subject matter is the controversial CAFÉ – Comparisons of Atypicals in First Episode of Psychosis - study.  This was the study in which Dan Markingson committed suicide.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;It appears that there was no head-to-head with a control group taking a placebo pill. Nor was there a control group featuring &#39;old&#39; types of &#39;antipsychotic&#39;. If that was the case then it is very poor study. If you are just looking at 3 &#39;new&#39; subtypes of a &#39;new&#39; class - then what on earth can you hope to show from the data.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry and Suicide Prevention:  A 30-year Failed Experiment</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatry-and-suicide-prevention-a-30-year-failed-experiment/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article on Mad in America dated September 17, 2013.  It&amp;rsquo;s titled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/09/nz-psychiatrist-psychiatrys-medical-model-suicide-prevention-30-year-failed-experiment/&#34;&gt;Psychiatry &amp;amp; Suicide Prevention: A 30-year Failed Experiment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;and was written by Maria Bradshaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria Bradshaw is the founder of CASPER, an organization that rejects the medical model of suicide prevention in favor of a sociological model.  Ms. Bradshaw founded CASPER after her son&amp;rsquo;s antidepressant-induced suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the gist of Ms. Bradshaw article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roger Mulder, MD, is head of psychiatry at Otago University in New Zealand.  For at least the last 15 years, he has supported the notion of psychiatric intervention as a suicide-prevention measure.  For instance, here&amp;rsquo;s something he wrote in 2008 in an article published in &lt;a href=&#34;http://lefnet.hu/resources/userfiles/file/Rihmer/Mulder%20APS%2008,%20suic%20during%20AD.pdf&#34;&gt;Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatry Is Intrinsically Flawed and Rotten</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatry-is-intrinsically-flawed-and-rotten/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/psychiatry-is-intrinsically-flawed-and-rotten/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Twitter yesterday, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RobStamatakis&#34;&gt;Robert Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt; commented:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;I have to ask, I don&#39;t understand.  Do you work in the UK?  Your descriptions of psychiatry are nothing I recognize.  These descriptions of psychiatry are nothing like the practice I see on a daily basis.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
I am certainly a very outspoken critic of psychiatry, and in that regard Robert&#39;s question/challenge is a fair one, to which I will try to respond.
&lt;p&gt;My primary criticism of modern psychiatry – and indeed the criticism that underpins all the others – is that its fundamental concepts are spurious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yobluemama2&#34;&gt;yobluemama2&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across an interesting article.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://psychrights.org/articles/081130JanneLarssonpsychiatricdrugssuicide.pdf&#34;&gt;Psychiatric Drugs and Suicide&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; by Janne Larsson, a reporter.  It&amp;rsquo;s posted on &lt;a href=&#34;http://psychrights.org/index.htm&#34;&gt;PsychRights.org&lt;/a&gt;, a law project for psychiatric rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article focuses on suicides committed in Sweden in 2006-2007, and the proportions of victims who had taken psychiatric drugs in the period prior to the suicide.  The study also covers data from autopsy reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information for the study was gathered under Sweden&amp;rsquo;s freedom of information act.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the main findings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Carl Elliot has an interesting post up about the possible link between the military&amp;rsquo;s increased use of psychotropic drugs and the concomitant increase in soldiers&amp;rsquo; suicide rates.   It&amp;rsquo;s titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://loathingbioethics.blogspot.com/2013/05/note-to-new-york-times-reporters-read.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note to New York Times reporters: Read the New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Like many reporters before them, James Dao and Andrew Lehren, [NY Times reporters], report that suicides in the military have risen to record levels.  What they don&#39;t mention is the fact that prescriptions of psychotropic drugs, many of them with black box warnings for suicide, have also risen to record levels.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another interesting article:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://leoniefennell.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/academic-integrity-in-ireland-and-the-uk-is-there-any-such-thing/&#34;&gt;Academic Integrity in Ireland and the UK: Is there any such thing?&lt;/a&gt; at Leonie fennells&amp;rsquo; Blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about financial ties between pharmaceutical companies and psychiatrists.  Same old story; different location.  It&amp;rsquo;s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Becky @yobluemama2 on Twitter for drawing my attention to this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SSRI’s and Suicide Risk for Adolescents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This issue has been debated for years, but was finally considered to have been put to rest by NIMH’s 2004 Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS).  This study essentially “found” that fluoxetine (Prozac) was effective in treating depression and did not involve an increased risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Whitaker’s most recent &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mad-in-america/201202/the-real-suicide-data-the-tads-study-comes-light&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; points out that TADS actually found that adolescents treated with fluoxetine had a markedly higher risk for suicidal activity than those who received a placebo.  Robert also outlines the various statistical and methodological ploys that were used to conceal this finding and to sanitize the final report.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
