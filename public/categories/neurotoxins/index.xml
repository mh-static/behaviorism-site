      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a post called:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/19/do-major-tranquilizers-make-things-worse/&#34;&gt;Do Major Tranquilizers Make Things Worse?&lt;/a&gt;  The post was based on a study by Drs. Harrow and Jobe in which they speculated that the high relapse rate of &amp;ldquo;schizophrenics&amp;rdquo; who stop taking their drugs may have more to do with drug &lt;i&gt;withdrawal&lt;/i&gt; than the supposed drug efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, at BeyondMeds, pointed out that these drugs should not be called tranquilizers because some of their effects (e.g. akathisia, tardive dyskinesia, etc.) are anything but tranquil.  And this, of course, is a good point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
