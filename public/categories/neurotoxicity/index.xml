      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an editorial by Henry Nasrallah, MD, in last month&amp;rsquo;s edition of &lt;em&gt;Current Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.  Dr. Nasrallah is the journal&amp;rsquo;s editor-in-chief.  The title of the article is &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/uploads/media/007_0713CP_FromTheEditor_FINAL.pdf&#34;&gt;Haloperidol clearly is neurotoxic.  Should it be banned?&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt; Haloperidol is marketed under the brand name Haldol, but its patent has long expired, and a generic version is available and inexpensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quote from Dr. Nasrallah&amp;rsquo;s article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;If clinicians who use these decades old drugs were to keep up with medical research and advances in knowledge, we would realize what a travesty it is to use a brain-unfriendly drug such as haloperidol when we have many safer alternatives. A massive volume of knowledge has emerged over the past 15 years about the neurotoxicity of older neuroleptics, especially haloperidol—knowledge that was completely unknown before.   Second-generation antipsychotics have been shown to be much safer for the brain than their older-generation counterparts (although they are not more efficacious).&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
