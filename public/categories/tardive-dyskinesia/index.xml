      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting February 11, 2014, article on Peter Breggin&amp;rsquo;s website:  &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://breggin.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=308&#34;&gt;$1.5 Million Award in Child Tardive Dyskinesia Malpractice&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/i&gt;Thanks to Mad in America for the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the opening paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;On February 11, 2014 a Chicago jury awarded $1.5 million to an autistic child who developed a severe case of tardive dyskinesia and tardive akathisia while being treated by psychiatrists with Risperdal and then Zyprexa between 2002 and 2007. The drug-induced disorder was diagnosed when he was fifteen years old and by then had become disabling and irreversible.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article on Harvard Law Petrie-Flom Center&amp;rsquo;s blog titled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2013/09/19/daubert-as-a-problem-for-psychiatrists/&#34;&gt;Daubert as a Problem for Psychiatrists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;  It was written by Alex Stein and is dated September 19.  [Thanks to Dustin Salzedo for drawing my attention to this in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/09/24/ssris-impair-learning/&#34;&gt;comment on an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article deals with the legal rules governing the admission of expert testimony.  Apparently there are two different sets of rules in this area, known respectively as Frye and Daubert.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the late 80&amp;rsquo;s, I worked for a while in an addictions unit that was located on the grounds of a State Hospital in West Virginia.  Clients would arrive on 72-hour holding committals from the counties, and if the psychiatrist felt that the client needed to stay longer than that (which was almost always the case), then either the client had to convert to voluntary status, which is what happened in most cases, or the hospital had to arrange for a hearing in front of a judge.  For convenience, a local judge would come in and the hearing would be held in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
