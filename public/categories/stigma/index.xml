      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday, October 7, 2013, The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper ran the following headline:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/5183994/1200-killed-by-mental-patients-in-shock-10-year-toll.html&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;1,200 Killed By Mental Patients.  Shock 10-year toll exposes care crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  It took up almost all of the front page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headline precipitated a great deal of protest from politicians, advocacy groups, mental health professionals, and others.  The general points in most of these protests were that the headline was sensationalistic, misleading, and would serve to increase the stigma associated with &amp;ldquo;mental illness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
