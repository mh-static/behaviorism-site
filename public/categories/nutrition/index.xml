      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is well known that nutrition is important, and that a great many people today – of all ages – are not receiving adequate nutrition.  It&amp;rsquo;s a huge subject, and is covered on lots of websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago (June 7), there was an article on Mad in America called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.madinamerica.com/2013/06/can-psychosis-be-treated-with-nutrition/&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can Psychosis be Treated with Nutrition?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  It was written by Bonnie Kaplan, PhD and Julia Rucklidge, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article is about a boy, whom the authors call Andrew (not his real name).  He had some early developmental problems, and by age 10 was displaying hallucinatory and delusional behavior.  He spent six months in a mental hospital, and was prescribed a wide range of psychoactive drugs, including neuroleptics.  His overall level of functioning on discharge was about the same as it was on admission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
