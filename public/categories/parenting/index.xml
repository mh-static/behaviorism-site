      <title>ADHD:  The Hoax Unravels</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/adhd-the-hoax-unravels/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the risk of stating the obvious, ADHD is not an illness.  Rather, it is an unreliable and disempowering label for a loose collection of arbitrarily chosen and vaguely defined behaviors.  ADHD has been avidly promoted as an illness by pharma-psychiatry for the purpose of selling stimulant drugs.  In which endeavor, they have been phenomenally successful, but, as in other areas of psychiatry, the hoax is unraveling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Drugging Toddlers for Inattention, Impulsivity, and Hyperactivity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 16, the New York Times ran an article titled &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/us/among-experts-scrutiny-of-attention-disorder-diagnoses-in-2-and-3-year-olds.html?_r=0&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thousands of Toddlers Are Medicated for A.D.H.D., Report Finds, Raising Worries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;by Alan Schwarz.  Here is the opening sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;More than 10,000 American toddlers 2 or 3 years old are being medicated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder outside established pediatric guidelines, according to data presented on Friday by an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
The CDC official is Susanna Visser, MS, DrPh, Acting Associate Director of Science for the Division of Human Development and Disability, and she was speaking at the annual Rosalyn Carter Georgia Mental Health Forum.  I have not been able to find the text of Ms. Visser&#39;s speech.  (It will probably be published later.)  Meanwhile, there is a good deal of information in Alan Schwarz&#39;s article.  Here are some more quotes:
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;The report, which found that toddlers covered by Medicaid are particularly prone to be put on medication such as Ritalin and Adderall, is among the first efforts to gauge the diagnosis of A.D.H.D. in children below age 4. Doctors at the Georgia Mental Health Forum at the Carter Center in Atlanta, where the data was presented, as well as several outside experts strongly criticized the use of medication in so many children that young.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Social Services and Psychiatry</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/social-services-and-psychiatry/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding Justina Pelletier and her family has expanded its scope in recent months, and has now become a general public scrutiny of Massachusetts&amp;rsquo;s Department of Children and Families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 29, State Governor Deval Patrick gave a press conference in which he announced the resignation of DCF Commissioner Olga Roche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s a very real risk of confusing some issues here.  The sad fact is that, despite the enormous strides we have made as a society, there are still a great many children who are abused and neglected.  Every state in the US has a social services department, one of whose statutory responsibilities is to investigate reports of abuse and/or neglect.  The case workers who conduct the investigations are required to follow set procedures.  Often they find that the allegation is unfounded, and the investigation is terminated.  When they do find probable cause, they are required by law to present their findings to a judge, who scrutinizes the evidence in accordance with the normal judicial procedures.  The social services department, the parents, and the child are usually represented by attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Justina Pelletier: The Debate Continues</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/justina-pelletier-the-debate-continues/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;On April 1, 2014, Slate published an online article titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/04/justina_pelletier_s_mitochondrial_disease_boston_children_s_hospital_suspects.html&#34;&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Mitochondrial Disease or Medical Child Abuse?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;  The author is Brian Palmer.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/slate_fare/2006/08/about_us.html&#34;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt; is a daily, general interest web magazine, founded in 1996, that provides &amp;ldquo;analysis and commentary about politics, news, business, technology and culture,&amp;rdquo; and is a subsidiary of the Washington Post.  Brian Palmer is Slate&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;chief explainer.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, the article tries to explore the central question in Justina&amp;rsquo;s case:  does she have mitochondrial disease or is she a victim of medical child abuse?  The author does a good job of defining the various terms, unraveling the issues, and presenting both sides of the argument, though on balance he comes down in favor of Boston Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital.  Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;Justina Pelletier is the 15-year-old girl who is at the center of a dispute between her parents and the Psychiatry Department at Boston Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justina, who lived with her parents in Connecticut, had been diagnosed with mitochondrial disease, a rare and debilitating illness, and had been receiving treatment for this from Mark Korson, MD, Chief of Metabolism Services at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February of last year, Justina&amp;rsquo;s parents took her to Boston Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital with flu-like symptoms.  Dr. Korson had recommended an admission to Boston Children&amp;rsquo;s so that Justina could be seen by Alex Flores, MD, a gastrointestinal specialist who had recently transferred from Tufts to BCH.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Problem of Blame</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/the-problem-of-blame/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2014 05:52:05 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/the-problem-of-blame/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;On January 27, I posted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2014/01/27/maternal-attachment-in-infancy-and-adult-mental-health/&#34;&gt;Maternal Attachment in Infancy and Adult Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;In this article I reviewed a longitudinal study by Fan et al.  The main finding of the study was:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;“Infants who experience unsupportive maternal behavior at 8 months have an increased risk for developing psychological sequelae later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
In my article, I pointed out that the correlation between the low maternal attachment ratings and subsequent &#34;mental health&#34; issues was not perfect, so clearly this was not the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; factor involved in the adult children&#39;s subsequent problems.  But I also made the point that what we do as parents affects how our children function in adulthood.
&lt;p&gt;For me this is simply an obvious fact of life that tragically has been barred from discussion by the psychiatric mantra – that all significant problems of thinking, feeling, and/or behavior are genetic-linked brain illnesses, and that parents couldn&amp;rsquo;t have impacted the outcome one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Living-With-Parents Blues</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/the-living-with-parents-blues/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the general rise in economic indicators over the past year or two, there are still many young adults who, for economic reasons, have had to move back in with their parents.  A proportion of these people become depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression is the normal human reaction to loss, disappointment, or a general sense of unfulfillment.  Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that young people who have to move back in with their parents might be depressed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;rsquo;re happy to take some of the credit for our children&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;successes&lt;/i&gt;, we should also accept a share of the responsibility when they &lt;i&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t do so well&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 70&amp;rsquo;s, I met an elderly gentleman in a social context.  I&amp;rsquo;ll call him James.  He was in his early 80&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to talking, and found that we had a good deal in common – primarily a love for the land, the forests, gardening, and just generally being active.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More on Postpartum Depression</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-on-postpartum-depression/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 09:14:03 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/more-on-postpartum-depression/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/2013/04/24/postpartum-depression/&#34;&gt;post on postpartum depression&lt;/a&gt; which has generated a certain amount of negative comment.  For this reason, I thought it might be helpful to clarify some points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEFINITION AND EXPLANATIONS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSM makes no mention of postpartum depression as such.  The closest it comes is major depressive disorder with postpartum onset.  In other words, the APA conceptualizes postpartum depression as ordinary major depression (which can incidentally range in severity from mild to severe) which happens to occur in the postpartum period.  This is in marked contrast to the popular notion that postpartum depression is somehow a function of the postpartum woman&amp;rsquo;s hormones, and is fundamentally different from other forms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Postpartum Depression Not an Illness</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/postpartum-depression-not-an-illness/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2013 09:43:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/postpartum-depression-not-an-illness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of the bio-psychiatric-pharma faction is to &lt;strong&gt;expand turf and sell more drugs&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is a multi-faceted endeavor, one component of which is disease mongering.  This consists of using marketing techniques to persuade large numbers of people that they have an illness which needs to be treated with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regards to postpartum depression, it is an obvious fact that some mothers do indeed experience a measure of depression in the period after giving birth.  The term postpartum depression has in the past been generally understood to mean that the problem had something to do with hormones.  Today brain chemicals are blamed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Internet Addiction: A Bad Habit, Not An Illness</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/internet-addiction-a-bad-habit-not-an-illness/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2013 17:54:02 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/internet-addiction-a-bad-habit-not-an-illness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The DSM-5 drafting committee considered including Internet addiction in the upcoming revision, but eventually backed off, at least for now.  Apparently they decided to put it in the category &amp;ldquo;requiring further study.&amp;rdquo;  So it&amp;rsquo;ll be in DSM-6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people are being given the &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; anyway – and of course, the &amp;ldquo;treatment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AN ILLUSTRATIVE CASE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TallaTrialogue&#34;&gt;Tallaght Trialogue&lt;/a&gt; for sending me a link to a recent article in the UK&amp;rsquo;s MailOnline.  It was written by Rebecca Seales and Eleanor Harding.  You can see it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2312429/Four-year-old-girl-Britains-youngest-iPad-ADDICT-Shocking-rise-children-hooked-using-smartphones-tablets.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In DSM-5, A-D-H-D Still Spells Misbehavior</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/in-dsm-5-a-d-h-d-still-spells-misbehavior/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a central theme of this website that there are no mental illnesses/disorders, and that the psychiatric medicalization of ordinary human problems is arbitrary, spurious, and destructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widespread acceptance of ADHD as a mental illness/chemical imbalance has no scientific underpinning, but rather is based on marketing and promotion.  The ADHD &amp;ldquo;diagnosis&amp;rdquo; is particularly destructive, in that it targets &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt;, and serves as the justification for &amp;ldquo;treating&amp;rdquo; these children with dangerous drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Psychiatric &#34;Diagnoses&#34; for Children</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/psychiatric-diagnoses-for-children/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 14:40:49 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/psychiatric-diagnoses-for-children/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/BeyondMeds&#34;&gt;Monica&lt;/a&gt;, I came across an article by Marilyn Wedge, PhD.  It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;i&gt;Six Problems with Psychiatric Diagnosis for Children. &lt;/i&gt;  You can read it &lt;a href=&#34;http://beyondmeds.com/2012/10/08/psych-dx-for-children/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Psychiatric diagnoses contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders are not classified by causes like genuine medical diseases.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;&#34;Perhaps worst of all, a child who has been labeled with a psychiatric diagnosis grows up believing that there is something wrong with her, that she is somehow “abnormal.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was about eleven or twelve, I had reasonably good social skills with my peers, but I was shy and awkward with adults. Our neighbor, Mrs. F., was a very pleasant lady who loved to spend time in her front yard with her flowers.  Often, as I came up the walk to our door, I would pass her.  She always gave me a nice greeting, to which I would respond by gazing at my toes and grunting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Play Therapy</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2013 10:17:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/play-therapy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across an interesting article &lt;a href=&#34;http://fiddaman.blogspot.co.nz/2013/02/psychiatric-medication-or-play-therapy.html&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Psychiatric Medication or Play Therapy?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bob Fiddaman, a New Zealand writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article compares the efficacy and dangers of play therapy vs. pharmaceutical products for children with various problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some quotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;…play therapy outcome studies support the efficacy of this intervention with children suffering from various emotional and behavioral difficulties.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on marketing psychiatric medication.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt; &#34;Front groups that purport to fly the mental health flag are, in fact, nothing more than agents, pimps for the pharmaceutical industry.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mandatory Mental Health Screenings for Schoolchildren</title>
      <link>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/mandatory-mental-health-screenings-for-schoolchildren/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2013 19:55:10 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://behaviorismandmentalhealth.com/posts/mandatory-mental-health-screenings-for-schoolchildren/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A regular commenter to this website has drawn my attention to a bill that has been proposed in the Connecticut state legislature.  The bill would require public school and homeschooled children to be assessed by mental health practitioners at grades 6, 8, 10, and 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill, sponsored by Senator Toni Harp and Representative Toni Walker, is in response to the recent Sandy Hook murders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it starts.  Given the built-in vagueness of the DSM, and the inclusiveness bias of the mental health business, the outcome of these screenings (should the bill become law) is predictable: more and more parents disempowered with regards to their parenting responsibilities; more drugged children, and, tragically, more mass murders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a week ago an article appeared on the ‘net concerning an attempt by parents to ban ice cream vendors from a playground in Brooklyn, New York.  The piece was reprinted in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/slopers_creamy_river_lcaxb1lj4D0SHqo4f2K3GO&#34;&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently some of the parents are upset because the arrival of the vendors stimulates requests for ice cream from the children, which results in confrontation and bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsible parents everywhere will recognize the dilemma.  Ice cream has little or no nutritional value, but children like it.  So do we stand our ground or do we give in?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post I described frotteurism, which the APA lists as one of their mental disorders/illnesses.  The central theme of this blog is that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; no mental illnesses – that mental illnesses are essentially psychiatrists’ ways of conceptualizing ordinary human problems for the purposes of consolidating turf and legitimizing the use of drugs to alter people’s behavior and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that the behaviors in question are not problems.  They certainly are.  Frotteurism is a case in point.  A man who uses the crowd cover of trains and buses to press his genitals against non-consenting females clearly &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; a problem.  The question is:  how can we &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; this behavior?  Why does he do it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONDUCT DISORDER
&lt;/strong&gt;
The essential feature of Conduct Disorder, according to the APA, is a “repetitive and persistent pattern” of rule breaking or activity which violates other people’s basic rights.  The manual identifies four broad categories of behavior under this heading:  aggression; destruction of property; theft or deceitfulness; and serious violation of rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSM goes on to state that individuals with this disorder display little concern for the feelings or welfare of others, are frequently callous and indifferent to other people’s pain and loss, and show little in the way of feelings of guilt or remorse.  Poor frustration tolerance, irritability, temper tantrums, and recklessness are cited as frequently associated features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Can They Just Invent Illnesses?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The notion of a professional group such as the APA sitting in their councils and committees inventing illnesses for themselves to treat seems so preposterous that a measure of disbelief on the part of the reader is understandable.  In its historical context, however, the development is not so surprising.  The original 1952 DSM was very simple and unpretentious, and whilst part of the APA’s motivation in drafting the document was undoubtedly to draw some credibility and respectability to their profession, there is at the same time nothing to suggest any great drive at that time towards aggrandizement or service expansion.  However, having agreed in 1952 that neurosis was a form of mental disorder, it was inevitable that subsequent revisions of the manual would attempt to define this feature further and look for subdivisions of the general category.  This, of course, is exactly what has happened, and the current version of DSM lists literally dozens of disorders of this sort, although the general term neurosis is no longer used.  (For an interesting discussion of this matter, see Karen Franklin’s post at &lt;a href=&#34;http://forensicpsychologist.blogspot.com/2008/10/dsm-makeover-what-will-they-come-up.html&#34;&gt;In The News&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
