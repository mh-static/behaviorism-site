    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This issue has been debated for years, but was finally considered to have been put to rest by NIMH’s 2004 Treatment for Adolescents with Depression Study (TADS). This study essentially “found” that fluoxetine (Prozac) was effective in treating depression and did not involve an increased risk of suicide.
Robert Whitaker’s most recent post points out that TADS actually found that adolescents treated with fluoxetine had a markedly higher risk for suicidal activity than those who received a placebo. Robert also outlines the various statistical and methodological ploys that were used to conceal this finding and to sanitize the final report.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The debate is over. Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos. And yet the “depression-is-an-illness” lobby continues to grasp for straws.
Fiona Godlee, editor of the British Medical Journal, recently cited “evidence” of the efficacy of antidepressants. For a critique of the Godlee article go to Duncan Double’s website “Critical Psychiatry.”
Surprise finding! - Antidepressants are only very marginally more effective than placebos.
What this means in effect is that people are “curing” their own depression (gasp), and perhaps don’t really need the mental health practitioners (double gasp).

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In 1973 the APA removed homosexuality from its list of “diagnoses,” and in its place they created a new “diagnosis” – gender identity disorder.
The essential feature of this so-called illness is a marked and persistent rejection of one’s biological gender and a repeated desire to be of the opposite gender.
I’ve touched on these issues in the posts on homosexuality. So I won’t repeat that material here. There is a recently reported development, however, that warrants some attention. A recent Associated Press article out of Chicago reports that sex-changing treatment for children is “on the rise.” This report was picked up by media outlets all over the country, and probably overseas.

    <p>A few weeks ago I recommended Taking America Off Drugs by Stephen Ray Flora. Well, he has also written The Power of Reinforcement (State University of New York Press, 2004), and this also is well worth reading.
Reinforcement is a crucial concept in psychology, and in this book Dr. Flora clarifies the matter and dispels the misinformation.
Buy it; read it; keep it close.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Daniel Carlat’s blog carries an interesting item. It seems that a lady named Suzy Chapman started a site called dsm5watch, in which she expressed criticism of the DSM. Well, the APA didn’t like this and sent her a cease and desist letter, claiming that the string “DSM-5” is trademarked, and that she was infringing their rights. She complied, changing the name of her site to dxrevisionwatch.
What I find interesting here is that the APA claim to be interested in public comment. I guess as long as it doesn’t get too critical.

    <p>Taking America Off Drugs by Stephen Ray Flora
A few weeks ago, in a comment, A Behaviorist Fan recommended the above book to me. It came out in 2007, and I don’t know how I missed it at the time. But I’ve read it now and it’s a superb piece of work.
Definitely a must buy and must keep close at hand. Stephen analyses the various “diagnoses” listed in DSM. He points out their behavioral nature, and describes how they can be ameliorated with relatively simple behavioral techniques.

“A shortage of Adderall, which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, shows little sign of easing as manufacturers struggle to get enough active ingredient to make the drug and demand climbs.
Adderall, a stimulant, is a controlled substance, meaning it is addictive and has the potential to be abused. The Drug Enforcement Administration tightly regulates how much of the drug&#39;s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) can be distributed to manufacturers each year.
