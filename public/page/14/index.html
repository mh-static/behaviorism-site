    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>After Monday’s post, I received the following tweet from Dr. Huda:
&#34;Dear @BigPhilHickey I find debates over Twitter r largely pointless I am (slowly) writing a book outlining my views&#34;
To which I reply: I never suggested a debate over Twitter. In fact, I stated very clearly that &#34;… Twitter, while an excellent medium for certain kinds of communication, is not a suitable vehicle for serious debate.&#34; This entire matter was started by Dr. Huda&#39;s assertion on Twitter that I hate psychiatry, and that I get its concepts wrong. In response, I invited Dr. Huda &#34;… to critique any of my writings – to set out which of psychiatry’s concepts I &#39;get wrong&#39;, and to point out the flaws in my analysis.&#34; I also made the point that Dr. Huda&#39;s original tweet was a way of avoiding the issues. Today&#39;s follow-up tweet strikes me as more of the same. So, at the risk of laboring the point, let me make myself perfectly clear. I am inviting – indeed encouraging – Dr. Huda to critique any of my writings. They can be found at Behaviorism and Mental Health. He may write his critique anywhere he chooses, and if he will let me know where it can be found, I promise to reply.

    <p>According to the APA, intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by angry aggressive outbursts that occur in response to relatively minor provocation.
This particular label has an interesting history in successive editions of the DSM.
DSM I (1952) Intermittent explosive disorder does not appear as such in the first edition of DSM, but the general concept is clearly discernible in “passive-aggressive personality, aggressive type”:
&#34;A persistent reaction to frustration with irritability, temper tantrums, and destructive behavior is the dominant manifestation.&#34; (p 37)

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In recent years, we’ve seen an increasing number of articles and papers from psychiatrists in which they seem to be accepting at least some of the antipsychiatry criticisms, and appear interested in reforms. It is tempting to see this development as an indication of progress, but as in many aspects of life, things aren’t always what they seem.
Last month (June 2015), The Lancet Psychiatry published a paper online in their Personal View series. The paper is titled Childhood: a suitable case for treatment?, and the authors are Ilina Singh and Simon Wessely. Dr. Singh is Professor of Science, Ethics &amp; Society at King’s College London, and is cross-appointed to the Institute of Psychiatry. Dr. Wessely is professor of psychological medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, and President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The first benzodiazepine – chlordiazepoxide – became available, from Hoffman-La Roche, in 1960, under the brand name Librium. It was soon followed by:
diazepam (Valium) 1963; nitrazepam (Mogadon) and oxazepam (Serax) in 1965; temazepam (Restoril) 1969; clorazepate (Tranxene) 1972; flurazepam (Dalmane) 1973; clonazepam (Klonopin) 1975; lorazepam (Ativan) in 1977; and alprazolam (Xanax) in 1981; etc.
Benzodiazepines are categorized as sedative/hypnotics, which means that they have a relaxing, generally pleasant, sleep-inducing effect, and were embraced promptly by psychiatry for the &#34;treatment&#34; of anxiety, tension, worry, sleeplessness, etc. In this respect, the benzodiazepines largely replaced the earlier barbiturates, which had received a great deal of negative publicity because of their much publicized role in lethal overdoses, both accidental and intentional.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>On October 12, 2014, the eminent psychiatrist Allen Frances, MD, participated in a panel discussion at the Mad In America film festival in Gothenburg, Sweden. After the festival, he wrote an article – Finding a Middle Ground Between Psychiatry and Anti-Psychiatry – for the Huffington Post Blog, summarizing the positions he had discussed at the festival. The article was re-published on MIA on October 26, 2014.
The article is ostensibly an attempt to find common ground between psychiatry and its critics, but the piece contains numerous distortions and omissions which I think need to be identified and discussed.

    <p>BACKGROUND
On June 19, 2015, I published a post titled Allen Frances’ Ties to Johnson &amp; Johnson. In that post, I set out some very serious allegations against Dr. Frances. I drew these allegations from a document titled Special Witness Report dated October 15, 2010. The report was written by David Rothman, PhD, Professor of Social Medicine at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Dr. Rothman’s report was produced in the context of a lawsuit filed by the State of Texas against Janssen Pharmaceutica, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson.
