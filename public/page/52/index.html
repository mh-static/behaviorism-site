The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) was formed in 2007. Its purpose is “…to undertake meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for psychiatric disorders…” The authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In recent times a good deal of criticism has been directed towards the practice of involuntarily committing individuals to state and private mental hospitals. Most of this criticism focuses on the lack of effective due process; conflicts of interest in the case of private facilities; and failure to adequately explore alternatives.
In my view, all of these criticisms are valid, and warrant attention.
But there is another side to the story that is seldom aired outside the mental health centers. A great many clients like going to the mental hospital; they plan their trips in advance and “freak out” at the appointed time, knowing that the knee-jerk response of the mental health center will be a court-ordered admission.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Years ago I was director of a county mental health center in an Eastern state. Shortly after taking the position, I became concerned that clients were being involuntarily committed too readily and without exploration of other options. I issued an instruction that all such activity had to be approved by a middle manager before it could proceed. This measure aroused enormous resistance from the front-line staff.
There was one client – let’s call him Charlie – who was committed to the State Hospital every year, usually in July. Every July, he would become “agitated,” would scream profanities at his elderly mother, and break things around the house. He carried a “diagnosis” of schizophrenia.

The researchers examined the Northern Ireland prescribing database and discovered that when people were admitted to nursing homes, the rate at which they were prescribed anti-psychotic drugs increased from 1.1% to 20.3%!

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Explanations:  Spurious and Valid
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>One of the central themes on this website is that psychiatric diagnoses are spurious and have no explanatory value. This contention is central to my entire argument, and for this reason I thought it might be useful to discuss the matter in some detail. Let’s start by examining what is meant by an explanation.
Almost as soon as a child can talk, he begins to ask questions. He asks why does it rain; why does grass grow; why is the sun hot; why is iron hard; why does wood float on water; why do cats eat mice; and so on. What the child is doing is trying to find meaning and system in the world which he sees and feels and tastes and hears and smells. He is looking for explanations. So, for instance, if a child were to ask: “Why is iron hard?” a conscientious parent who had some scientific background might venture an explanation like this: “Because the molecules in the iron are bound together in a way which prevents them from moving around too much. By contrast, the molecules in soft substances, like water, are not bound as tightly, and so they move apart when you stick your finger in. The molecules in the iron won’t move apart easily – you would have to hit them with a hammer and chisel to get them apart.”

&#34;Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on marketing psychiatric medication.&#34;

    <p>When we were young, most of us devoted a good deal of time and energy to squabbling with other children. To the dismay of our parents, we because adept in the use of impolite language, and kept our stock of insulting words and phrases up-to-date. As adults we are more socially sophisticated. We no longer call one another rude names – at least not openly. Tragically, however, many people go through their entire adult lives calling themselves names, which although not as vulgar as the insults of childhood, are considerably more destructive.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Several of my recent posts have been about fundamental issues. Here&#39;s something a little lighter.
  On the coast of Maine near the Machias Estuary, the Atlantic Ocean pounds the cliffs and beaches. The scenery is wild and beautiful, and there are lots of seagulls.
One spring a seagull was born named Jimmy Brady. He was a fine little seagull, but his brothers picked on him something terrible, and he grew up feeling nervous and very unsure of himself. He thought he was ugly, and when it came time to jump off the cliff and fly, Jimmy just couldn’t do it. He didn’t believe that a seagull, as horrible and klutzy as he believed himself to be, could ever soar over the waves as a seagull should.

    <p>Until just a few years ago, the spurious nature of mental illness received little or no attention either in professional circles or in the general media. There were a few of us “cranks” who poked away at the issue, but peer condemnation was usually swift and outspoken. On one occasion I was called an “anti-science Nazi” for daring to suggest that the condition known as ADHD might have more to do with ineffective parental discipline than with brain chemistry. We were voices in the wilderness.
