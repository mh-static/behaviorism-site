    <p>On September 27, the New York Times published an article called Lacking Rules, Insurers Balk at Paying for Intensive Psychiatric Care. The author is Reed Abelson. Thanks to S. Randolph Kretchmar on Twitter for the link.
The article describes the kinds of conflicts that can occur between people with “mental illnesses” wanting “treatment,” and insurance companies who sometimes are reluctant to pay for this “treatment.”
The article is fairly balanced. It presents a number of actual cases of people who were experiencing difficulty. But it also tries to do justice to the insurance company’s position:

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>On September 25, PsychCentral ran an article on this topic. The article was a commentary on a 2013 meta-analysis conducted by Katharine Barnard, PhD, et al of the University of Southamptom, UK.
The meta-analysis examined three systemic reviews and 22 studies.
RESULTS
&#34;There was evidence that antidepressant use is associated with type 2 diabetes. Causality is not established, but rather, the picture is confused, with some antidepressants linked to worsening glucose control, particularly with higher doses and longer duration, others linked with improved control, and yet more with mixed results. The more recent, larger studies, however, suggest a modest effect.&#34;

The research was conducted in Taiwan. The authors studied the records of 5,377 psychiatric inpatients with gastrointestinal bleeding between 1998 and 2009. Study subjects served as their own controls, i.e. the incidence of bleeding in the period following the antidepressant prescription was compared with the incidence of bleeding during a period when they were not taking antidepressants.
