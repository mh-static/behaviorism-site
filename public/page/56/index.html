<p><strong>Alternative perspective on psychiatry&rsquo;s so-called mental disorders</strong><br>
<em>PHILIP HICKEY, PH.D.</em></p>
<p>I am a licensed psychologist, presently retired. I have worked in clinical and managerial positions in the mental health, corrections, and addictions fields in the United States and England. My wife and I have been married since 1970 and have four grown children.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;mental health&rdquo; as used in the name of this website is simply a term of convenience. It specifically does not imply that the human problems embraced by this term are illnesses, or that their absence constitutes health. Indeed, the fundamental tenet of this site is that there are no mental illnesses, and that conceptualizing human problems in this way is spurious, destructive, disempowering, and stigmatizing.</p>

<p>The purpose of this website is to provide a forum where current practices and ideas in the mental health field can be critically examined and discussed. It is not possible in this kind of context to provide psychological help or advice to individuals who may read this site, and nothing written here should be construed in this manner. Readers seeking psychological help should consult a qualified practitioner in their own local area. They should explain their concerns to this person and develop a trusting working relationship. It is only in a one-to-one relationship of this kind that specific advice should be given or taken.</p>

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>At present the pharmaceutical companies are responsible for testing the effectiveness and safety of their own products. In recent years there have been numerous reports of dishonest practices in this area, including suppression of unfavorable results and massaging of data to create the impression that a drug is more effective than is actually the case.
Recently, Christopher Lane publicized a particularly egregious example of this from England.
The drug at the center of this scandal is reboxetine. It is not available in the US, but is widely prescribed in the UK and in sixty other countries for depression, panic disorder, and ADHD.

    <p>On August 22, thanks to the generosity of an anonymous deceased donor and his bereaved family, I received a kidney transplant. The surgery was successful, and the kidney is working very well.
I have to take immunosuppressants, of course, and I am having some difficulty adjusting to these. I am still very tired, and but generally my condition is improving.
I hope to be “back on the air” soon.

    <p>It was widely reported last week that James Holmes, the alleged cinema shooter, will be pursuing a “mental illness” defense. Details are scarce because the judge has issued a gag order, but it is likely, given the available information, that the lawyers will argue that because of his psychiatric history he is incompetent to stand trial. It is also likely that they will bring in some eminent psychiatrist(s) who will confirm his “diagnosis” and claim that at the time of the offense he didn’t know what he was doing, or something similar.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The current issue of the National Psychologist (July/August 2012) has an interesting article about the impending introduction in Australia of mental health checks for three-year-olds. The examinations are part of a nationwide, government-funded program called Healthy Kids Check. (Doesn’t that sound good?) The program, which will be voluntary, is supported by the Australian Medical Association.
The idea, of course, is to scoop children into the mental health maw at an early age, ensuring them client-for-life status.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I came across an interesting article the other day.
It Is Time to Rename the DSM, by Bruce A. Thyer, PhD, Florida State University, Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry, Vol 8, No. 1, Spring 2006
Dr. Thyer points out that although the DSM claims to be atheoretical, its contention that the various “mental illnesses” reside within the individual, as opposed, for instance, to being understandable reactions to adverse life events, is in itself a theoretical stance. Dr. Thyer also points out that in the manual’s description of conduct disorder there is a little known (and in my experience even less used) caveat to the effect that this so-called diagnosis should not be assigned if the misbehavior is “…simply a reaction to the immediate social context.” This is laudable, of course, on the part of the APA, but Dr. Thyer goes on to pose the obvious question: Why is this exclusion not applied to all the conditions listed? He then answers his own question: Because “…if this practice was followed, the very concept of mental disorders threatens to evaporate, in favor of viewing these as environmentally driven phenomena.”

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Histrionic Personality Disorder is not an Illness
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few days ago it was reported in the media that the defense lawyers representing Jerry Sandusky, the football coach accused of sexually molesting young boys, plan to present evidence that he has histrionic personality disorder, and to argue that this should be accepted as a mitigating factor.
The logic here is sound. Most jurisdictions accept the presence of a bona fide illness as a mitigating factor – sometimes to the point of total exculpation. Consider the case of a middle-aged man who has a heart attack while driving a car. He passes out and the car, out of control, kills someone. In cases like this the driver frequently isn’t even charged.
