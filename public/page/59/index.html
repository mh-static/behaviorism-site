  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The concept of personality is very firmly established in mental health circles and in academic psychology. It is also widely used in common speech, and is frequently offered as having explanatory value, when in fact it has none.
Consider the following conversation:
“Why is Mary so quiet and reserved?”
“Oh, that’s just her personality.”
Or “Why is Michael so aggressive and argumentative?”
“That’s his personality.”
In statements like this the term “personality” is presented as if it explained the behavior in question, when in fact it is merely descriptive. The responder to the question, “Why is Mary so quiet and reserved?” might just as well have said: “Because she is so quiet and reserved.” The so-called explanation adds nothing in terms of understanding how Mary got to be quiet and reserved. As I have discussed elsewhere – the acid test for an explanation is to ask:

    <p>I’m now in retirement, but during my professional career I usually (almost always) wore a suit and tie when I went to work. I enjoyed my work, and I was very comfortable in that role.
But I’m also a committed remodeler. Apart from the time when I was acutely ill, I’ve always had at least one remodeling project on the go – literally all my adult life.
So when I got home from work, I changed “uniforms.” Off with the suit and tie, on with the paint-splattered jeans, plaid shirt, scruffy sweater, and tool belt. And here again, I was very comfortable.

    <p>MPD became an official APA “diagnosis” with the publication of DSM-III in 1980. It has since been renamed as dissociative identity disorder. The criteria are:
A. The presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states (each with its own relatively enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self).
B. At least two of these identities or personality states recurrently take control of the person&#39;s behavior.

    <p>Jacqueline (aka Laika) has this week’s Grand Rounds up at Laika’s MedLibLog.
One might wonder if many posts could be found that fit the theme: Data, Information, and Communication. There are approximately fifty posts in this Rounds, so many that you will want to go back several times, so as not to miss anything interesting. Dr. Herb Mathewson has a post - Want to Go Dutch…or French…or German? - on learning about other countries’ healthcare systems. There are several posts about social media and medicine - too many to mention, but obviously a source of information for those interested in learning more about this subject - most appropriate for those of us who are of an older, pre-computer age. Some posts are very serious (My Review of Lifetime’s Movie: Five), while others, such as ZDoggMD’s Doctors Today, are of a lighter nature. Stop by and have a look.

    <p>In a recent comment on my last post Jeanne raised some important questions concerning homosexuality. These are issues where considerations of political correctness and religious dogma have stifled genuine discussion and dialogue. I will try to address these questions openly and straightforwardly.
The sex or gender of a person expresses itself in five general ways.
1. Every cell of the body is recognizable under a microscope as male or female.
2. Anatomically: The male develops testicles; the female develops ovaries. These differences are discernible in the embryo within a few weeks of fertilization.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Homosexuality: The Mental Illness That Went Away
    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Post edited and updated January 2, 2013, to reflect clarifications as a result of interactions with the many people who have left comments. I thank them for their input.
********************
According to the American Psychiatric Association, until 1974 homosexuality was a mental illness. Freud had alluded to homosexuality numerous times in his writings, and had concluded that paranoia and homosexuality were inseparable. Other psychiatrists wrote copiously on the subject, and homosexuality was “treated” on a wide basis. There was little or no suggestion within the psychiatric community that homosexuality might be conceptualized as anything other than a mental illness that needed to be treated. And, of course, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness in DSM-II. (The DSM – Diagnostic and Statistical Manual – is the APA&#39;s standard classification of their so-called mental disorders, and is used by many mental health workers in the USA and other countries.) Then in 1970 gay activists protested against the APA convention in San Francisco. These scenes were repeated in 1971, and as people came out of the “closet” and felt empowered politically and socially, the APA directorate became increasingly uncomfortable with their stance. In 1973 the APA’s nomenclature task force recommended that homosexuality be declared normal. The trustees were not prepared to go that far, but they did vote to remove homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses by a vote of 13 to 0, with 2 abstentions. This decision was confirmed by a vote of the APA membership, and homosexuality was no longer listed in the seventh edition of DSM-II, which was issued in 1974.
