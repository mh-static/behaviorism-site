  <div class="post-content"><p><b>First story</b></p>
<p>In the early 70&rsquo;s I worked in Grendon Prison in England.  The facility was run on the lines of a therapeutic community – lots of meetings, groups, etc&hellip;  One of the prisoners – let&rsquo;s call him William – was serving time for burglary.  He was about 24 years old, and during his intake interviews he told us that he was a member of a small quasi-religious sect who believed that doomsday was imminent and that they would be the chosen few.  He talked about these matters openly and with a good measure of passion, and after a few weeks the other prisoners were describing him as &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; and a &ldquo;nutcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had a great many professional visitors at Grendon.  Social workers, nurses, psychologists, etc.., would spend a few days observing and attending our meetings.  On one occasion we had some newly-trained psychiatric nurses on the unit, and during one of the plenary meetings there was some focus on William, and he recounted (again passionately) his end-of-times story, and defended it vigorously against the dismissive input from the other prisoners.</p>
<p>After the meeting the staff and professional visitors met briefly to reflect on the meeting.  Someone asked one of the nurses what he thought of William.  I can recall his response verbatim:  &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s schizophrenic, he&rsquo;ll never get better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>The nurse shrugged.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they told us in class.&rdquo;  His peers nodded confirmation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Second Story</b></p>
<p>Fast forward about twenty years, and I was working in a mental health center in the US.  We lived about 20 miles out of town, and I drove in and out each day.  One morning I picked up a hitchhiker. He was about 60 or 65 years old, and told me that his car wouldn&rsquo;t start.  He thanked me for giving him a ride because he needed to get to work.</p>
<p>In the course of chatting I mentioned that I worked at the mental health center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I spent eleven years at the State Hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the problem?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Schizophrenia.  But I got better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you manage that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the nurses,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she nice to you?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she was a witch.  She was mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did that help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the other staff were always so nice.  You know, they&rsquo;d say:  &ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Do you need anything?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stress yourself,&rdquo; and all that.  But she would say:  &ldquo;Are you still here!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s time to get off your ass!&rdquo;  And she would never smile – just scowl all the time.  We hated her.  But one day something clicked, and I started to listen to her.  I got off my ass and started to take an interest.  And one day they sent me home.  They said I was cured.  That was thirty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any problems?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head.  &ldquo;Just the car.&rdquo;</p>
