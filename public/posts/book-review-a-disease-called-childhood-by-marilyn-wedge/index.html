Marilyn Wedge draws unstintingly, and with evident compassion, from her wealth of professional experience, and stresses the supreme importance of getting to know our children and providing the love and structure that they so desperately need.\nI strongly recommend this book for parents, teachers, and physicians who write prescriptions for this so-called illness. The book will also be helpful for anyone who is concerned about the extent to which pharma-psychiatry is systematically pathologizing human existence.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Disclosure: I have no financial links to this book or to any books/materials endorsed on this site.",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Avery, a member of Penguin Group USA, has recently published <strong><em>A Disease Called Childhood</em></strong>, by Marilyn Wedge.  Marilyn has a PhD in psychology and works as a family therapist.</p>
<p>In 2014, fully 11% of American children had received a &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo; of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  It is widely believed by these children, their parents, the press, the public, and government agencies, that this loose collection of vaguely defined behaviors constitutes an illness – specifically a chemical imbalance in the brain, which is corrected by stimulant drugs.</p>
<p>Dr. Wedge&rsquo;s book is a timely reminder that the &ldquo;science&rdquo; on which this perspective rests is highly questionable, and that there are alternative perspectives and alternative ways of working with children.</p>
<p>Here are some quotes from the book:</p>

(p xii)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"There is another aspect of ADHD that worries me.  As stimulants have come to be prescribed for ever larger numbers of children, our society's very perception of childhood has changed.  Instead of seeing ADHD-type behaviors as part of the spectrum of normal childhood that most kids eventually grow out of, or as responses to bumps or rough patches in a child's life, we cluster these behaviors into a discrete (and chronic) "illness" or "mental health condition" with clearly defined boundaries.  And we are led to believe that this "illness" is rooted in the child's genetic makeup and requires treatment with psychiatric medication." (p 17)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"A serious problem for teachers is that an ADHD diagnosis exempts a child from having to take accountability for his behavior." (p 91)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Each individual has a unique story that ultimately reveals the true reasons for troubled behavior.  A child's individual story is both a clue to the cause of his troubles and a signpost that guides us to help him." (p 113)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"And in our medicalized society, deviating from the norm tends to be interpreted to mean there is something "biologically wrong" with the child." (p 123)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Using medication to suppress the life story of a child who is suffering from trauma subjects him to yet another form of maltreatment." (p 137)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"If we realize that children can be overactive and impulsive for any number of reasons, we can avoid reducing their behavior to a simplistic diagnosis of ADHD." (p 195)</p>
