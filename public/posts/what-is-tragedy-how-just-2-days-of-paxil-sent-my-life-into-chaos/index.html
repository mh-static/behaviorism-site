<title>What Is Tragedy? How Just 2 Days of Paxil Sent My Life Into Chaos | Behaviorism and Mental Health</title>

by Michael Coughlin
I survived the tragic and sudden death of my 12-year-old brother, the near-death of my second brother, and the horrific suicide of my uncle, all with barely any medication. I became an extremely happy and high-functioning adult through holistic and spiritual growth. I loved life itself.
Then a freak occurrence happened. I got a pinched nerve in my neck that caused anxiety, and my doctor prescribed Paxil, a dangerous antidepressant, without any screening, a formal diagnosis, or any fair warning of the risks or explanation of how long I would need to take the drug for. I was always against antidepressants because I studied them in college and I knew they were often overprescribed, and I let my guard down for just one day. After just two days of the drug, I couldn’t fall asleep naturally for weeks, something that never occurred in my entire life before. I developed hypomanic symptoms, sleeping only a few hours a night for three weeks, and my doctor was nowhere to be found to help.  He remained in denial. The BU Center for Anxiety &amp; Related Disorders discharged me when I was in need of help.  The McLean Mental Hospital didn’t return my phone calls. I would later learn that I was suffering from Antidepressant-Associated Hypomania and no one could get me the care that I needed.">

My heart shattered.\nOn my saddest day of anger and outrage, I started to choke myself with my hands to feel what it felt like to suffocate to death. I took a belt and hung it over the door hinge. I started to choke myself with the belt to get a feel for what it would be like to hang myself. I thought to myself, “If only my doctor could see my face right now. Maybe then he would change his ways? Probably not.” I took the belt from around my neck and off the hinge. I said to myself, “Not today. Not today.”\nThis is tragedy.\n",
