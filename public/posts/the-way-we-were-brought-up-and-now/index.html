Also i have seen some anger from the members who rightfully get angry and want to get through to the people who are not getting what the drugs can do to many. it is not just about the meds with mental health. It is a big part, but see we need to have autonomy within mental health or it will be warring forever over the things that we were duped about in the beginning.\nThe way I was brought up was don’t ask don’t tell. And not the way it is used for the military. It is in effect the way it was back then in the family. I have seen what families can do to the mentally ill person within the family. it was a desperate time for all of us who were there in that time. I know that when I was told I had bipolar I did try to fit all the symptoms in little box so it made sense. I took the medications given to me then everything went from bad to worse. I was getting worse give more meds and then shock treatments when every med they threw in me was not supposedly helping. This is something I know others can relate to. I have a genetic condition that affects all meds I take but I am guessing most of the psych meds were going through the liver in a way it tripped up the genetic problem. That is the personal part to my seeing eyes. I can tell you the meds are crap to people who have this type of problem and no matter how many times we are told it is us, it is not us. It is the meds. You want to know what it is okay with me that this is what it is. It is not okay to me when I see others who take the meds and they have little problems that we see. it bothers me that I cannot just take a pill to help it. Most people got into the thinking of that and it expanded to all meds really. BUT I can say it is psych meds that get the most flack when it comes to not wanting to take them. We get how we don’t care about our mental health or we are being stupid you name it i had heard it. On top of that the govt has been getting nito this and we need them to help not penalize those who are trying to get better in ways we know might help if the meds do not. It is a sad time for those who just want a life not drugged to the point we cant talk right or we get tardive dyskenisia (sp not real sure tonight) I have had emotional issues since I was little. I have had a traumatic past that will curl the toes on some to know the whole truth of it. I do not disclose everything except it was bad and was severe abuse. That says it all. When I say what i say on this site it is experience and knowledge of what I learned as I was trying to come to terms with my own problems with meds and that it wont help me that much.\nNow the here and now with psychiatry is ther is more than one way, but they are holding the non med stuff down some because, yes, drugs sell and it needs a psychiatrist to diagnose the illness to get the drugs we are supposed to need. After that then we are told of therapy as an add on to the meds. Some only really need the threrapy and there are man types to help. Why because there are varying degrees of what is needed for the person. We are all different no matter who or what tell us we can take the same things. it si not true and has been proven by genetics and other scientific matters. Who knows why we think we can just do all for one. The mind is more intricate than that. It has been known we are not all the same cloth. And to wrap it all in a big bow and say all fixed and then cut corners to get to the big bow sucks for people. it leads to two sides of every story when there is a third and more sound story that has both sides of the story equal within it. Well it could easy enough. The way i wrote it it looks easy. it is not. Add in people who were duped by all meds or nothing.\ni am not even saying the meds do not help some. I have seen people it helped with, but the meds themselves can hurt anyone no matter if they help them or not taking it too long. The meds are like an infection to me. Foreign invaders and all the body wants is to defend itself from the foreign introduction. It is how i see ti for everyone to get and understand meds. Every med is a foreign substance that the body will defend itself from. Hence side effects and all this and that. Simply put when you put food in your mouth if it has something your body does not need it will get rid of it no matter how it has to. Food is essential for the brain and it essential for health and mental health. We get all the crap they spray on them and guess what we eat it and hope. All the toxins on the food or in it is expelled. if it is not the body will fight this and try to get it by any means necessary. I am sure even the pro drugs will get this. We cannot help how we were taught either. We relied on these people to be honest and it became so dishonest it is silly to think is is honest. Too many storied verified saying how they are hurting us.You cannot dismiss the stores because some of them have factual info in them. it does not stop the higher uppers take a mentally ill person life and just slam it to the wall by saying you have to or you will be penalized for real yo. Really guys. I had an emotional issue and a physical one. The physical issue was way more important than me going off and screaming because I had enough of the crap and I just blew the hell up. Well the police made me go to the er and it was listed under psych. I have adrenal tumors that are misdiagnosed and I have a disease called syringomeylia may have the rare second half of the whole shebang as well called Chiari Malformation. You want to know something these affect not only my moods, but it affects many other things including my blood pressure. I was being made to go for being crazy when I was calming down and my blood pressure was showing it. What messed me up is the way everyone looks at mental health like it is evil. Really if you look at it I am right. How many times i get upset about my treatment and what do they say it is my emotions that is the problem. No bother to look at my other issues they stop there and I get the never ending looks at oh man she is just nuts or insane. Guess what that is demeaning to the nth. It is worse them having cancer to me and that is a horrible disease as well. Yes I personally know about the ravages of cancer with a friend who had cancer cells everywhere. It was the worst thing to look at and i did not care o loved that she was smiling when she saw me and knew i would try to make it better. Well take how mental illness is treated and look at cancer. The physical crap and the meds used deplete the body so much. The drugs they use are hard core. The drugs we use some are that hardcore, but you only see it later on and they do not cause everything to look like they are hurting you at first. Some can kill you if you take too much, some can mentally make you psychotic when you normally are not. Enough said. I am sure i will get yelled at for what i said. The truth is who cares I know and the people who do know I feel for you. I am so sorry you get what I mean because it is sad to me hoe many people do know.\nI know in this day we are still looked at violent when we we are not. Behaviors are not treated as they need to be treated with therapy and not so many drugs if they are needed. I know for sure i am not the only one who has a gentic issue with all meds. Yet is not well known. I know that if you have a disease that is so rare it is not caught at the get go, you get trated even worse then you were before. I got hit by a doctor because he was angry at me for what he said i was doing. He said Iwas faking it and it was horrble to lay in the er not being able to defend myself. This is the times of the now too. It is not just one doctor it is all doctors the doctors who do not know everything and are not boned up on rare anything are the worst especially if they feel that being a doctor means they know everything. The ego that wont quit. Pychiatrists are not the only ones who act dumb. For all the book learnig they are not experienced in it as a mental healt recipient is. They only learned about it. It goes so far beyond the neds issue too. Why they made it that way. The upper echelon doctors the govt who should have been more proactive instead of punitive. it sucks to no end to see that the people fall for the ones who need mental health to help them .They are the ones who need to take the frugs and see if they get along with them. They should be looked at the way we get looked. And if you are sick oh hell no do not even say it is the disease it is you.\nTo end all ends I may be angry at how i get treated and I am sure that when those who know what I have been through come out we can fight to have equality to know when to say yes or no to drugs. For it to be a choice we make and not forced. The Govt and the states who are for more punitive should should do exactly what you tell us to do. Take those meds you think are good for us and put yourselves in to the reality of what we see everyday. Not so much angry as feel like you call the shots in a free country. I get if they are violent, but that is when you penalize the person not before it happens. Leave the kids alone let them grow first before you decide to kill their growth. Done and said. The before it was the same horrible look at the mentally ill the after is the same but so much worse. We did not get better we got worse in mental health and we should be able to defend who we are as people. By the by I will add one thing if they do kill or hurt most likely they are behaving with what they had learned. It is all learned behaviors that are shown to be the evil part of it. That may be emotions, but if you look at the serial killers who were caught they had many behaviors before they killed. Most mentally ill do not. That is a behavior issue of you see it. The depressed even have behaved this way due to being abuse or hurt severely. Believe me when I say this I do not say it jokingly. I have seen many sides of the mind and the broken ones by abuse or anything even if it si the brain that does it. It cannot be helped until you know the whole story. Please get it. And I am done for now. Let me see how it goes with the whole thing I said. I am not expecting anything that would not be expected. Thank you and good night.\nA Reader\n",

<p>I have written before in this. I am hoping to make something all known for you who have worked hard for freedoms we may not always get.

We cannot help how we were taught either. We relied on these people to be honest and it became so dishonest it is silly to think is is honest. Too many storied verified saying how they are hurting us.You cannot dismiss the stores because some of them have factual info in them. it does not stop the higher uppers take a mentally ill person life and just slam it to the wall by saying you have to or you will be penalized for real yo. Really guys. I had an emotional issue and a physical one. The physical issue was way more important than me going off and screaming because I had enough of the crap and I just blew the hell up. Well the police made me go to the er and it was listed under psych. I have adrenal tumors that are misdiagnosed and I have a disease called syringomeylia may have the rare second half of the whole shebang as well called Chiari Malformation. You want to know something these affect not only my moods, but it affects many other things including my blood pressure. I was being made to go for being crazy when I was calming down and my blood pressure was showing it. What messed me up is the way everyone looks at mental health like it is evil. Really if you look at it I am right. How many times i get upset about my treatment and what do they say it is my emotions that is the problem. No bother to look at my other issues they stop there and I get the never ending looks at oh man she is just nuts or insane. Guess what that is demeaning to the nth. It is worse them having cancer to me and that is a horrible disease as well. Yes I personally know about the ravages of cancer with a friend who had cancer cells everywhere. It was the worst thing to look at and i did not care o loved that she was smiling when she saw me and knew i would try to make it better. Well take how mental illness is treated and look at cancer. The physical crap and the meds used deplete the body so much. The drugs they use are hard core. The drugs we use some are that hardcore, but you only see it later on and they do not cause everything to look like they are hurting you at first. Some can kill you if you take too much, some can mentally make you psychotic when you normally are not. Enough said. I am sure i will get yelled at for what i said. The truth is who cares I know and the people who do know I feel for you. I am so sorry you get what I mean because it is sad to me hoe many people do know.</p>
<p>I know in this day we are still looked at violent when we we are not. Behaviors are not treated as they need to be treated with therapy and not so many drugs if they are needed. I know for sure i am not the only one who has a gentic issue with all meds. Yet is not well known. I know that if you have a disease that is so rare it is not caught at the get go, you get trated even worse then you were before. I got hit by a doctor because he was angry at me for what he said i was doing. He said Iwas faking it and it was horrble to lay in the er not being able to defend myself. This is the times of the now too. It is not just one doctor it is all doctors the doctors who do not know everything and are not boned up on rare anything are the worst especially if they feel that being a doctor means they know everything. The ego that wont quit. Pychiatrists are not the only ones who act dumb. For all the book learnig they are not experienced in it as a mental healt recipient is. They only learned about it. It goes so far beyond the neds issue too. Why they made it that way. The upper echelon doctors the govt who should have been more proactive instead of punitive. it sucks to no end to see that the people fall for the ones who need mental health to help them .They are the ones who need to take the frugs and see if they get along with them. They should be looked at the way we get looked. And if you are sick oh hell no do not even say it is the disease it is you.</p>
<p>To end all ends I may be angry at how i get treated and I am sure that when those who know what I have been through come out we can fight to have equality to know when to say yes or no to drugs. For it to be a choice we make and not forced. The Govt and the states who are for more punitive should should do exactly what you tell us to do. Take those meds you think are good for us and put yourselves in to the reality of what we see everyday. Not so much angry as feel like you call the shots in a free country. I get if they are violent, but that is when you penalize the person not before it happens. Leave the kids alone let them grow first before you decide to kill their growth. Done
and said. The before it was the same horrible look at the mentally ill the after is the same but so much worse. We did not get better we got worse in mental health and we should be able to defend who we are as people. By the by I will add one thing if they do kill or hurt most likely they are behaving with what they had learned. It is all learned behaviors that are shown to be the evil part of it. That may be emotions, but if you look at the serial killers who were caught they had many behaviors before they killed. Most mentally ill do not. That is a behavior issue of you see it. The depressed even have behaved this way due to being abuse or hurt severely. Believe me when I say this I do not say it jokingly. I have seen many sides of the mind and the broken ones by abuse or anything even if it si the brain that does it. It cannot be helped until you know the whole story. Please get it. And I am done for now. Let me see how it goes with the whole thing I said. I am not expecting anything that would not be expected. Thank you and good night.</p>
