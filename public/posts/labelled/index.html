<meta name="description" content="I’d been seeing an NHS clinical psychologist for thirteen years.  Let’s call her Marie and me Sarah (all names are changed in my story). We talked about what had happened to me and how it had affected me, we looked at what I found difficult. We considered strategies to manage my distress that sometimes manifested as profound anxiety and dissociation, and at others as depression. We used relaxation techniques, grounding techniques. She offered phone support between appointments if she had space, set up a good plan with the GP for their support and for me to use three days of low dose diazepam if I was become overwhelmed and exhausted, just enough to get me back on track. I had some art therapy. We thought about all aspects of my life and how I could best look after myself within my friendship/family groups.But I began to struggle more as we wrestled the most traumatic episodes of my childhood. I started to feel increasingly suicidal for more of the time and the self-harm increased. I needed more help. I lived alone. We’d often thought that were there a safe place to go, a restful, peaceful, caring place, that would have been so good. Marie and the GP (rightly) suggested hospital would not be that and reviewed what could be done. With some persuading, the Crisis Team began to offer me some support from 2005. They were mixed. One CPN, Matt, was fantastic; most saw me as ‘hysterical’ or a bottomless pit. But they didn’t know me. Then the Trust axed Marie’s post at a crucial point in my psychodynamic therapy. I was in turmoil. A new clin psych was found, Simon. It took me a time to trust a man, but eventually work became possible and we got back to exploring the part of my past that so often caused me to feel I was a nothing and a no-one with no right to life. I felt I was fighting this beast called suicide who was sucking me in such that only my toes were sticking out of its clamped jaw, jaws my arms could not prize open. I just had to hang on, to not be swallowed, for 2 days until the appointment with Simon, and then there would be help.">

I was in turmoil. A new clin psych was found, </span><span style="color: #222222;">Simon. It took me a time to trust a man, but eventually work became </span><span style="color: #222222;">possible and we got back to exploring the part of my past that so </span><span style="color: #222222;">often caused me to feel I was a nothing and a no-one with no right to </span><span style="color: #222222;">life.

I just had to hang on, to not be </span><span style="color: #222222;">swallowed, for 2 days until the appointment with Simon, and then there </span><span style="color: #222222;">would be help.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">The next day the phone rang to say the Simon has gone off sick. I </span><span style="color: #222222;">couldn’t get anyone to believe that my desperation on hearing that </span><span style="color: #222222;">was not caused by him going off sick but by how I was feeling and had </span><span style="color: #222222;">been for several days. My panic was at not knowing what to do now. I </span><span style="color: #222222;">had no-one to talk to, no-one to help me save myself. The Crisis Team </span><span style="color: #222222;">were antagonistic, they thought I was behaving like a spoilt child </span><span style="color: #222222;">because the therapist was missing a week. I have no idea how I </span><span style="color: #222222;">survived. Just thinking about it brings me out in a cold sweat. That </span><span style="color: #222222;">was early July. No Simon all July, all August. No word of when or if </span><span style="color: #222222;">he might be back.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Simon was part of a service that I didn’t really fit into, but it </span><span style="color: #222222;">was felt one of his team should ‘pick me up’. Two months later I </span><span style="color: #222222;">received an appointment to see George, a Medical Psychotherapist (i.e. </span><span style="color: #222222;">psychiatrist + psychoanalytical psychotherapist). He, not </span><span style="color: #222222;">unreasonably, felt we should move towards my care being on a more </span><span style="color: #222222;">‘normal’ footing, i.e. based in the CMHT (I’d managed without </span><span style="color: #222222;">them until then) and to let the CMHT decide ‘What next?’ I was </span><span style="color: #222222;">pretty mad about all this because the only reason my therapy had </span><span style="color: #222222;">ceased was Simon’s sickness. My healthcare Trust seemed to think </span><span style="color: #222222;">I’d had enough therapy (money spent on me), and that was that. No </span><span style="color: #222222;">clinical review, nothing. But George wasn’t for that, either. Rather </span><span style="color: #222222;">he thought that were anyone else to take me on for psychotherapy on a </span><span style="color: #222222;">more common 50 mins per week, no other contact basis, it would be </span><span style="color: #222222;">helpful to me to have a CPN to turn to for additional support. This </span><span style="color: #222222;">meant George had to write a referral to the CMHT. He did. He copied me </span><span style="color: #222222;">into it. He put a diagnosis in the letter: Dissociative Identity </span><span style="color: #222222;">Disorder. I was horrified to be labelled and to find out there was a </span><span style="color: #222222;">name for what they thought was ‘wrong with me’. What I thought was </span><span style="color: #222222;">wrong was the fallout of having been repeatedly raped and tortured for </span><span style="color: #222222;">over ten years by my parents.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">It transpired that the only way the Crisis Team had accepted a </span><span style="color: #222222;">referral from Marie was when she agreed to put a diagnosis on the </span><span style="color: #222222;">referral form. She used the same one as George but never told me and </span><span style="color: #222222;">asked the Crisis Team not to use it with me either.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">The label was additional trauma in an already traumatized time in </span><span style="color: #222222;">which I’d had a breakdown and tipped towards psychosis (so George </span><span style="color: #222222;">explained when pressed a couple of years later). The assessment </span><span style="color: #222222;">appointment came through with the CMHT. I met with a psychiatrist, </span><span style="color: #222222;">Helen and a CPN who drank tea and looked bored or sceptical. Helen </span><span style="color: #222222;">said she didn’t think I’d cope with psychotherapy. ‘But I’ve </span><span style="color: #222222;">been coping with it for years, it’s been helping me, I am so much </span><span style="color: #222222;">better,’ I said.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I was utterly devastated. I tried to manage over the weekend but knew </span><span style="color: #222222;">the edge was getting closer. I had everything ready – the pills, the </span><span style="color: #222222;">note, letter lined up to the people I cared about, the funeral </span><span style="color: #222222;">arrangements etc. I felt so bad I couldn’t call anyone. I didn’t </span><span style="color: #222222;">want to distress them. By the Tuesday morning I knew I couldn’t go </span><span style="color: #222222;">on any longer. There was only one person I felt I could burden with </span><span style="color: #222222;">how I was feeling. She was in the midst of moving house, she didn’t </span><span style="color: #222222;">have a mobile phone, I didn’t have her new address yet. Thankfully </span><span style="color: #222222;">she is a vicar so I managed to track down the phone number for that </span><span style="color: #222222;">parish’s vicarage. Not knowing whether she was there, and it being </span><span class="aBn" style="color: #222222;" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1758934780"><span class="aQJ">7.30am</span></span><span style="color: #222222;">, I picked up the phone and so did she.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">I talked, she listened. Then she said, ‘Sarah is there just one </span><span style="color: #222222;">thing that might make life worth living, no need to answer that now, </span><span style="color: #222222;">but will you think about it and I’ll phone back at </span><span class="aBn" style="color: #222222;" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1758934781"><span class="aQJ">6pm</span></span><span style="color: #222222;">, but ring </span><span style="color: #222222;">sooner if you need to.’ She did phone and I said: ‘Yes, I want to </span><span style="color: #222222;">have the chance to finish the therapy because only when I’ve </span><span style="color: #222222;">finished will I know whether I can live an enjoyable life. I owe the </span><span style="color: #222222;">child I was the chance for that.’</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">And so the fight began. Cutting a lot out, it was helped by Marie who </span><span style="color: #222222;">decided to act as an advocate for me from within her new job (in which </span><span style="color: #222222;">she no longer has clients). She told me it was me who convinced them, </span><span style="color: #222222;">but I feel sure she helped. I did see the bored CPN a couple of times. </span><span style="color: #222222;">She at least had the honesty to say she’d never worked with anyone </span><span style="color: #222222;">who experienced dissociation. I gave up on her when she criticized </span><span style="color: #222222;">Marie (and by implication, me) for taking so many years to work </span><span style="color: #222222;">through my traumatic past.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">The fight to complete the therapy made me angry for other people who </span><span style="color: #222222;">might not have had the articulacy or the capacity I had for that </span><span style="color: #222222;">fight. And it showed me I was not as vulnerable, weak and useless as </span><span style="color: #222222;">I’d thought.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Simon never came back to work. Nine months after he went off sick I </span><span style="color: #222222;">started work with George. With his help, I completed my journey, we </span><span style="color: #222222;">made me pretty much as whole as anyone else is. I had no hospital </span><span style="color: #222222;">admissions throughout the 21 years of therapy (with odd gaps). No </span><span style="color: #222222;">anti-depressants or anti-psychotics, just my occasional helper </span><span style="color: #222222;">diazepam, trusted to my control. I see Helen quarterly, we’ve stuck </span><span style="color: #222222;">up a workable relationship. We met with George a couple of times and </span><span style="color: #222222;">that really helped. I feel she’s on my side and respects me (as I do </span><span style="color: #222222;">her now).</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">As of July this year, and at the age of 56, I have a new label: Sarah </span><span style="color: #222222;">Cambridge BA (Hons) Creative and Professional Writing. I won a </span><span style="color: #222222;">University Prize for the highest undergraduate mark in the faculty and </span><span style="color: #222222;">a School Prize for academic achievement in the face of adversity. I </span><span style="color: #222222;">have emails from Marie, George and two members of the Crisis Team in </span><span style="color: #222222;">response to me sending them my graduation photograph. I treasure most </span><span style="color: #222222;">Marie saying: I knew you could do it, all of it. I am so proud of you.</span></p>
