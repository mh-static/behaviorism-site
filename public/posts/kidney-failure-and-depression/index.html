Happily, we now have some long-term [5-year] research – Correlation of antidepressive agents and the mortality of end-stage renal disease, by Tsai et al, which you can see here. This is a database search (not a randomized controlled trial), and so results have to be interpreted with caution.\nThe results of this study, which included data on 2,312 patients, were:\n1. Diagnosis of depression did not influence mortality rate (mortality rate in patients with depression: 26.5%; mortality rate in patients without depression: 26.2%. 2. Patients who had been given antidepressants had a significantly higher mortality rate (mortality rate: 32.3%) than those who had not (mortality rate: 24.5%) The likelihood that a difference of such magnitude would have occurred by chance is less than one in a thousand.\nThe authors do point out that this doesn't prove that the antidepressants were causing the excess deaths. (It might be that the drugs were being given to the people who were in poorer health to begin with.) But by the same token, it doesn't rule out the possibility of a toxic effect. In addition, it certainly constitutes a significant challenge to Dr. Watnick's contention that cases of depression have higher rates of mortality, and her recommendation that depressed individuals be given antidepressant drugs. People who are on dialysis have markedly diminished ability to clear toxic by-products from the blood stream. In dialysis circles, it is widely stated that the clearing power of regular (i.e. 3-times-weekly) dialysis is approximately 10%-15% as effective as a pair of functioning kidneys. So it is within the realm of possibility that toxic by-products from antidepressants could accumulate in the blood stream and have a detrimental effect. Dr. Watnick acknowledges this factor but suggests merely that “…the starting dose should be as low as possible and increased slowly if needed.”\nThe general problem is that antidepressants are being routinely prescribed as the first line response to any indication of despondency in an increasingly wide range of situations.\n",
