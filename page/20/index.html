  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There’s an interesting article in the June 2014 issue of the Journal of ECT. It’s written by Max Fink, MD, and is titled Celebrating 80 Years of Inducing Brain Seizures as Psychiatric Treatment. Dr. Fink is a psychiatrist and neurologist, and professor emeritus of psychiatry and neurology at the State University of New York, Stony Brook.
The article is short (approximately 400 words), and is essentially a tribute to Ladislas Meduna for his discovery “…that induced seizures alleviated severe psychiatric disorders…”, which Dr. Fink describes as “…a remarkable medical advance…”

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>On August 15, 2014, McGill-Queens University Press published Psychiatry Disrupted: Theorizing Resistance and Crafting the (R)evolution. The work is a collection of papers by various authors, edited by Bonnie Burstow, Brenda A. LeFrançois, and Shaindl Diamond. There is a Foreword by Paula Caplan, and a Preface by Kate Millett.
It is no secret that there is growing opposition to psychiatry. No longer marginalized and ignored, as in former decades, anti-psychiatry writers are proclaiming psychiatry’s spurious and destructive nature in a wide range of venues. Even the mainstream media is taking tentative steps in our direction.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve recently read Stigma and mental health problems: why psychiatric professionals are the main culprits, by Gary Sidley, PhD. You can find it on his website. It’s a concise, accurate, and compelling account of how psychiatry stigmatizes its clients. This is a particularly important topic, in that psychiatrists routinely assert that it is we mental illness deniers and critics who create the stigma.
Gary distinguishes public stigma (negative evaluation by the public), and self stigma, which arises when mental health clients accept these negative evaluations and begin to undervalue themselves.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I have had a severe depression since I was in high school. I’ve never had a bad life. I have had heart break and not very many good friends. I lost my virginity to a guy after three dates at 21. and i don’t love him or anyone else right now. I dont’ want to talk to him. I don’t want to see him again. I don’t want to have sex again. I’ve been raped in another country, in that i was so freakin drunk that i was about to have sex on a bench, but ,managed to get up and wlak away and he let me. Now, I drink and i feel the need to cut myself. I feel so alone, so scared of this feeling inside me and so embarrassed. I thought i had overcome this in my depression \but my leg is cut up and my hands and i don’t know where else to turn. I don’t want help from ‘professionals’. I got drunk one time and threatened to kill myself. I got beaten by the police and taken to the hospital. The next day i feel fine, and i know i should stop drinking, but I’m 21 and I JUST WANT TO BE NORMAL. It hurts me to know this is inside me and i hate it. The blood fades but the scars never do, and they’re on show for everyone who looks. What then? How do i explain this to other people? My shame, my skin, my depression? I do love my life and i always think that i make this great big progressions in my depression, yet here i am, cutting myself. Is it my subconscious telling me no i’m not okay or is it my depression acting out against my own happiness. Every time that i try to go out with friends, soomething happens to make them cancel, or not be able too. And here i am, cutting myself because i dont’ think that no one loves me because i’m worthless, fat, ugly, not fun, depressing, needy, scary, boring. Whatever. I’m alone, and they don’t see it. If they did, they probably wouldn’t even want to be around me or associated. I hate myself, because no one else seems to like me. I miss having fun and being surrounded by people.
