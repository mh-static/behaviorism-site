    <p>If we’re happy to take some of the credit for our children’s successes, we should also accept a share of the responsibility when they don’t do so well.
In the late 70’s, I met an elderly gentleman in a social context. I’ll call him James. He was in his early 80’s.
We got to talking, and found that we had a good deal in common – primarily a love for the land, the forests, gardening, and just generally being active.

    <p>A few days ago, there was an interesting item in the Dear Abby column of our local newspaper. Dear Abby is a general advice column written by Jeanne Phillips, and is widely read.
The letter in question was written by “Sibling Standing By,” who described his/her 63 year old sister as someone who “…takes no responsibility for her health.” The sibling goes on to say:
&#34;She’s extremely overweight because she overeats and doesn’t exercise. She complains every day that she feels &#39;terrible.&#39; (I call it self-pitying whining.)&#34;

    <p>I’ve recently come across (courtesy of Tallaght Trialogue on Twitter) an article titled: The Court: Electroshock treatments should not be forced on psychiatric patients. The original was in Israel Hayom, an Israeli newspaper, and was written by Edna Adato. The English version above was on occupypsychiatry.net, and was translated by Janna Weiss.
The article is brief, and the content is straightforward. As a result of a recent Israeli court ruling, electric shock treatment will not be administered against a person’s will, even if the person has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>BACKGROUND
In the last ten years or so, the anti-psychiatry movement has been gaining adherents, and has been growing more focused and more outspoken.
But we are not a unified group. I, for instance, take what I think would be considered a fairly extreme position. I believe that there are no mental illnesses; that the clusters of thoughts, feelings, and actions labeled as mental illnesses are better conceptualized as habits that have been acquired in accordance with the normal principles of behavior acquisition or as understandable responses to extreme life stressors. I further believe that conceptualizing these problems as illnesses has been disastrous for the individuals involved, and for society in general. In particular, I believe that psychiatry’s promotion of the idea that all problematic thinking, feeling, and behaving is caused by brain illnesses and can only be treated with drugs is causing extraordinary levels of physical damage to their clients. It is also severely stigmatizing and disempowering. As a culture, we are losing the notion that people can improve their lives through effort and application, and through mutual assistance and support.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>BACKGROUND
Those of us on this side of the debate, who criticize psychiatry for medicalizing and drugging virtually every problem of human existence, sometimes ask the question: If all these problems are truly illnesses of the brain, then why are they not being treated by neurologists?
The standard psychiatric response to this question has been: neurology deals with nervous system illnesses that result in problems of movement, sensation, physical pain, etc.; psychiatry deals with nervous system problems that result in disordered thinking, feeling, and general behavior. Psychiatry has never produced the proof that these latter problems are caused by illnesses of the brain/nervous system, but that’s a separate issue.

    <p>BACKGROUND
At the APA annual convention in San Francisco in May of this year, Chad Puffer, DO, of the Mayo Clinic, presented a poster display titled ECT Use in Adolescents at the Mayo Clinic. The poster was reported by Caroline Cassels of Medscape.com, a month later (ECT in Kids: Safe, Effective, Robust and …Underutilized), and drew critical comment a week later (July 2) from Kelly Patricia O’Meara of CCHR International.
I didn’t spot any of this until last week, when it came up on the Twitter feed from DxRevision Watch and Peter Kinderman.
