    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There’s an interesting article by Sonja Grover, PhD, CPsych, of Lakehead University, Ontario, Canada. It’s titled: Reification of psychiatric diagnoses as defamatory: Implications for ethical clinical practice. Thanks to Becky on Twitter for the link.
It’s an old article (2005), but definitely deserves another look. It was published in the journal Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry.
Here’s the abstract:
&#34;While the mental health professional generally has beneficent motives and an honest belief in the DSM diagnoses assigned to clients, such diagnoses may yet be defamatory when communicated to third parties. Mental health diagnoses invariably lower the individual&#39;s reputation in the eyes of the community. At the same time, DSM diagnoses are but one out of a myriad of possible interpretive frameworks. DSM descriptors for the client&#39;s distress thus cannot be said to capture the essence of the client&#39;s personhood. When a diagnosis is published as if it captured a definitive truth about an individual psychiatric client, it is, in that important regard, inaccurate. That is, such a communication meets the criterion for a reckless disregard for the truth or an honest belief but without reasonable basis insofar as it is considered to be anything more than a working hypothesis. Hence, in certain cases, DSM labeling may constitute defamation.&#34;

    <p>Last Monday (August 26), Lauren Spiro published a post on Mad in America. The post is titled The Today Show and ECT: The Full Story &amp; Informed Consent. Here’s the gist of Lauren’s article.
On August 20, the Today Show ran a segment on ECT (electric shock “treatment”). Lauren contends that the coverage was not balanced, but was pitched heavily in favor of shock “treatment.” Lauren provides a link to the segment, and also a transcript. I have watched the video, and read the transcript, and I agree that the coverage was very much pro-ECT, and that side effects were trivialized.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There’s an interesting article, Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function, by Anandi Mani et al in the current issue of Science.
Here’s the abstract:
&#34;The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some implications for poverty policy.&#34;

Depression is the normal human reaction to loss, disappointment, or a general sense of unfulfillment. Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that young people who have to move back in with their parents might be depressed.
